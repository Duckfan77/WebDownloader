<h1 id="chap1">Speck 30.2</h1>b'<p>We were broken, routed.</p>\n<p>When had it happened?&#160; When had we reached that critical juncture?&#160; Had one specific act or moment marked the point where the rank and file capes had stopped fighting and started merely trying to survive?</p>\n<p>Morale was failing, and had failed long ago.&#160; A good fifth of our fighting force here was made up of Nilbog&#8217;s creatures and Dragon&#8217;s suits, which self-repaired and kludged together with the remains of other damaged suits to return to the field again and again.&#160; That was <em>with</em> the reinforcements that were coming through Doormaker&#8217;s portals.</p>\n<p>Chevalier and Ingenue, the other Birdcage leaders and other teams were trying to gather into a defending force.&#160; Issue was, there wasn&#8217;t really a way to <em>defend</em>.&#160; Scion held the keys to all things power related, and any attack that didn&#8217;t penetrate a particular defense needed only to be tweaked, adjusted with a moment&#8217;s thought.&#160; Following that, it passed through forcefields, armor and time distortions like they weren&#8217;t even there.</p>\n<p>The same was true in terms of our ability to <em>attack</em>.&#160; I had a sense of Scion&#8217;s scale, because I&#8217;d seen his partner, and I&#8217;d gotten a glimpse of the sheer mass of the partner from how much had flowed through into our world as Scion had moved it.&#160; I could assume they were roughly equivalent in size, and that meant we were trying to tear through <em>landmass</em> of raw matter, and we were doing it a few handfuls at a time.</p>\n<p>I could look at how durable the partner entity&#8217;s flesh had been when Rachel and Lung had been tearing through it, extrapolate to the attacks we&#8217;d seen here.&#160; We weren&#8217;t doing nearly enough, especially if he was compartmentalizing the damage and keeping himself from losing more than a certain amount at a time.</p>\n<p>To top it all off, anything we found that <em>worked</em> only worked for a short time.&#160; Either the user died, or Scion adapted his defenses to become immune to it.</p>\n<p>I knew this.&#160; A good number of us knew some of it, especially the ones who&#8217;d attended the meetings with the major players.</p>\n<p>But for a large number of people on the battlefield, this wasn&#8217;t all common knowledge.</p>\n<p>For the others on the ground, this was a man with golden skin who didn&#8217;t seem to be bothered in the slightest by the vast majority of what we were throwing at him.&#160; At best, he seemed <em>annoyed</em>, by effects as massive as the ones String Theory and Gavel had dished out.&#160; At best, we gave him <em>pause</em> for a moment.&#160; He was toying with us in a way that made it clear he was holding back, yet it didn&#8217;t take away from the horror of his actions.</p>\n<p>It was impacting morale, instilling a kind of hopelessness, and that hopelessness was a big part of why things were falling apart before my eyes.</p>\n<p>I saw him generate a beam so thin I couldn&#8217;t make out anything but the glow around it, tracing it through a group.&#160; It cut into throats, arms, legs and chests.&#160; The wounded capes fell, all together.</p>\n<p>Blood welled out from the cuts the beam had made in their flesh.&#160; The damage wasn&#8217;t lethal, not yet, but it was bad enough that death was likely.&#160; Even inevitable.&#160; I saw a trace of golden light on the skin around the wound.&#160; The damage was spreading.&#160; It wasn&#8217;t the sort of injury a medic would be able to handle.</p>\n<p>Sixteen capes in all, left to feel their hot blood flow free, their lives seeping away.&#160; Not everyone Scion had targeted was in such bad shape.&#160; One had dodged, pulling a teammate out of the way.&#160; Another three or four had survived the attack by toughness alone, with armor and powers protecting them.</p>\n<p>Scion moved, advancing on them.&#160; One sphere of golden light, turning one of these hyper-tough capes into ash.&#160; And then he was in their midst, hitting them with physical blows, tearing them to pieces, each hit harder, faster and more gruesome than the last.&#160; A sweep of his arm and a cape with stone armor was torn in two.</p>\n<p>Two or three seconds and he&#8217;d taken nineteen capes out of action, wounding several more.&#160; But the <em>real </em>effect was on others, on capes who were now giving up, trying to get away from this slaughter.</p>\n<p>He advanced on the two who remained, and it was Chevalier who got in the way, slamming his cannonblade down, twenty feet long and eight feet high, a physical barrier in Scion&#8217;s way.</p>\n<p>Scion raised one glowing hand, not even slowing as he advanced towards his intended targets.&#160; The sword, to Scion, was little more than tissue paper.</p>\n<p>Which made it all the more surprising, to him and to me both, when he <em>stopped</em>, his hand touching the barrier and failing to tear through it.</p>\n<p>Chevalier drew the sword back, then <em>cleaved Scion.&#160; </em>The sword passed through the golden man&#8217;s shoulder, ribcage, and out his waist, cutting into the earth.</p>\n<p><em>Bisected.</em></p>\n<p>Chevalier remained where he was, hands on the handle of the weapon, making eye contact with Scion.&#160; Ingenue was only a short distance behind him, looking more like she was dressed up to go to a club than to be on a battlefield, with a little leather jacket and a dress with the slit up one side,&#160; her hair draped over half of her face.</p>\n<p>Just the same as we&#8217;d seen with the Siberian.&#160; The damage was there, but Scion was holding himself together.</p>\n<p>Scion withdrew himself from the sword.&#160; Chevalier slashed again, slamming Scion into the earth, then used a sweep of the sword to vault himself back.</p>\n<p><em>Scion&#8217;s a ghost, it&#8217;s a mask</em>.</p>\n<p><em>And whatever Tattletale says about him being human at his core, human on the surface or whatever else, he&#8217;s a natural disaster, not an individual.</em></p>\n<p><em>A force of nature.&#160; Impossible to control or prevent.&#160;&#160;</em>The words crossed my mind, and they were <em>my</em> words, but they weren&#8217;t my thoughts.</p>\n<p><em>Reminding me of the bad old days, Passenger</em>?&#160; I thought to myself.&#160; My bugs continued to gather around me.&#160; A familiar and comfortable presence, considering everything that was happening.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m not giving up!</em>&#160; My voice, sounding so far away, even in my own head, so young.</p>\n<p><em>Damn straight</em>.</p>\n<p>Chevalier blocked Scion&#8217;s beam with his sword, then moved the blade, pulling the trigger.&#160; The cannonball hit Scion, and knocked the golden man back.</p>\n<p>Capes were taking the opportunity to flee.</p>\n<p>I knew what I had to do, here.&#160; Even with a myopic, skewed perspective.&#160; I could guess what the ultimate price was going to be.</p>\n<p>Maybe a good part of myself was a monster.&#160; Maybe a part of me was still that girl who had very nearly gone on a rampage in her school, still that girl who would have been an angry, frustrated, aimless c-list villain, a footnote in a footnote in the grand scheme of things, forgotten by nearly everyone once the media frenzy had died down.</p>\n<p><em>The hell am I supposed to do!?</em>&#160; The memory was so clear I could almost hear my own voice.&#160; Had that anger ever really gone away?</p>\n<p>The world didn&#8217;t fucking make sense.&#160; <em>People</em> didn&#8217;t make sense.&#160; I&#8217;d been railing against it from the beginning.</p>\n<p>I dropped to the ground, cutting one of the boosters to the flight pack.&#160; I didn&#8217;t position my legs right, and I folded, landing on my knees and hands instead of on both feet.</p>\n<p>I felt a spark of fear, then another.&#160; Capes stopped in their tracks, and the ones behind them crashed into them, driving them forward, some toppling onto a disc a tinker was riding.&#160; Seven people, now inside my range.</p>\n<p>I could get a sense of their powers.</p>\n<p>The disc the cape was riding was a tinker device, hovering over the ground with a constant stream of air that sent dust billowing in low rolling clouds around the edges.&#160; A woman rode the platform, garbed in a green, flowing kimono-style dress, surrounded by some sort of tinker-derived cyborg bonsai trees on raised sections of varying height.</p>\n<p>I began to find my feet, using both my hands and the flight pack to get myself upright.</p>\n<p>I could feel the tree-girl&#8217;s fear, the fact that she was cornered.&#160; It was echoed across each of the seven who&#8217;d stumbled into my power&#8217;s radius, and it invoked memories.&#160; Different memories for each of them.&#160; For <em>her</em>, it called Leviathan to mind.&#160; Me running, being struck from behind.&#160; There was one case that reminded me of being with my dad in the room, wracked with shame and helplessness, a complete and total lack of direction.&#160; Another that, inexplicably, brought up the scene with Dragon and Defiant in the Arcadia High cafeteria.&#160; A sense of injustice, mingled with surrender.</p>\n<p>For another, for <em>two</em> others, it brought up Mannequin, but they were different scenes.&#160; Being in the empty factory with the innocents at the edges, a building rage, and being there when he&#8217;d attacked my territory the second time, after we&#8217;d saved Amy.</p>\n<p>In both of those cases, it was the same kind of rage I&#8217;d just been thinking about.&#160; To these two, I was the freak of nature standing in their way.</p>\n<p>I was broken, and I&#8217;d bitten off more input than I could chew.&#160; The passenger was tapping into the experiences it had shared with me, because that was the only way it could convey the signals I was getting from them.</p>\n<p>Which wasn&#8217;t what I needed.&#160; It was the wrong inputs.&#160; What I <em>needed</em> was to decipher their powers.&#160; The tinker with the trees&#8230; I could sense things about her that <em>weren&#8217;t</em> tapping into memories I understood.&#160; Something mental that I couldn&#8217;t relate to, out of my reach.</p>\n<p>I ordered them to turn.&#160; When they moved, they lurched.&#160; Unfamiliar proportions, different degrees of athleticism.&#160; Like my adjustment to my new arm and legs.</p>\n<p>Could I get used to moving them like I&#8217;d gotten used to the new limbs?</p>\n<p>Laughter disturbed me from my thoughts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Human shields?&#8221;&#160; A man asked, almost unintelligible with his coarse accent.&#160; &#8220;I love it!&#160; I was ganna shoot the bloody idjits in the backs, you&#8217;re &#8216;lowed to do that, &#8216;miright?&#160; But some cunt might get the wrong idea.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When I turned my head, all but one my minions turned their heads as well.&#160; My fault.&#160; I&#8217;d wanted the extra sensory input, and I&#8217;d instinctually tried to take it in with a share of my &#8216;swarm&#8217;.</p>\n<p>It was Acidbath.&#160; One of the Birdcage&#8217;s cell block leaders.&#160; He had the stylings of a rock musician or punk rocker who&#8217;d spent a little too much time doing drugs and not enough time playing his instrument.&#160; Worn around the edges, a little too full of himself.&#160; He&#8217;d been a bit player in the real world, caught up in his vices, yet had managed to take over and rule a cell block for three years after being sent to the Birdcage.</p>\n<p>He was still smirking, laughing a little, as he looked between me and Scion&#8217;s ongoing fight with Chevalier.&#160; He danced a little from foot to foot, tensing just a bit every time Scion moved.&#160; Not out of fear.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;This </em>is better,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;They wanna run and leave us assholes to do the fighting, you can say otherwise.&#160; Pin &#8217;em up and let Scion knock &#8217;em down.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>No.&#160; They aren&#8217;t meat shields.</em></p>\n<p>But I couldn&#8217;t tell Acidbath that.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t answer him because I couldn&#8217;t communicate.</p>\n<p>It galled me that he thought I&#8217;d use them as cannon fodder.&#160; Not least because he was right.&#160; <em>Partially</em> right, but that didn&#8217;t make it much better.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d compared myself to some pretty horrible individuals in the past, but Acidbath was something else.&#160; He was <em>low</em>, barely above dirt.&#160; He&#8217;d scalded his own brother with acid, and had gone after girlfriends and girls who had rejected him.&#160; The attacks hadn&#8217;t been lethal, but had melted flesh and the fat or muscular tissues beneath.&#160; I&#8217;d seen the pictures of the aftermath when I&#8217;d browsed his files, after the scar tissue had formed.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t think of worse ways to hurt someone, and he&#8217;d done it in impulsive acts of retaliation.</p>\n<p>If I was going to be a monster, I&#8217;d at least try to be smart about it, constructive.&#160; To have a <em>plan</em>.</p>\n<p>I set my new minions into action.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t get too caught up in the details.&#160; Their powers were a part of them like the venom was a part of a spider or centipede, or web a part of the spiders I controlled.&#160; I had to take it in without getting caught up in analyzing it, trusting the passenger to handle the essential details on autopilot.</p>\n<p>As my new minions rejoined the battle, I felt the tinker tap into that power that had previously been out of reach.&#160; I got a glimpse of how she operated, the world she saw; a distorted world much like I&#8217;d seen when I tried to look through my bug&#8217;s eyes.&#160; The trees were primed and loaded like guns.&#160; Tinker-herbalism, only it wasn&#8217;t very medicinal at all.</p>\n<p>I set her aside.&#160; The others&#8230; my passenger was better at controlling most of them.</p>\n<p>A cape in a black flowing costume who had powers I couldn&#8217;t decipher.&#160; I set him aside as well.</p>\n<p>The others were easier to use, and I wasn&#8217;t sure how much of it was because of their powers&#8217; similarities to my own.&#160; Focusing on them resulted in a deluge of fragmented memories, memories of me using my power in different ways.</p>\n<p>Two shaker-classification capes provided the majority of the offensive power.&#160; If I let them be, if I let things move on autopilot in their own way, then they used their power well enough.&#160; A telekinetic with an emphasis on small objects, with a storm of ball bearings and small stones from the road, and a cape that could create superheated shafts of energy, anchoring them between two objects.&#160; The memories were of my bugs attacking as a coordinated whole, of the threads I&#8217;d extended as tripwires and my attack on Echidna.</p>\n<p>Not that I was so graceful or effective in using their abilities.</p>\n<p>There was a woman, and focusing on her resulted in a deluge of fragmented memories, but these were memories of using my bugs to <em>observe</em>.&#160; A secondary power?&#160; Trying to tap into her <em>other</em> power resulted in thoughts of Atlas, the void in his midsection, of my relay bugs.&#160; Something incomplete?&#160; A kind of frustration.&#160; With my eyes, I could see her fingertips glowing blue.</p>\n<p>I moved her hand, and I saw a line drawn in the air.</p>\n<p><em>Something incomplete</em>.&#160; I moved her hand in a circle, and I closed the line.</p>\n<p>There was a small pop as the space we&#8217;d enclosed disappeared.&#160; My bugs could feel the air moving at the destination point.</p>\n<p>A teleporter with a somewhat irritating limitation.</p>\n<p>The other two looked like members of the Birdcage.&#160; Very possibly Acidbath&#8217;s underlings, though he hadn&#8217;t identified with them.&#160; Brutish, mean looking.&#160; One was armored in what looked to be fragmented pieces of pottery and glass, with flesh webbing between fragments, while the other was covered head to toe in biker tattoos, oddly doughy looking, with a power that was being channeled just under his skin.&#160; Focused air.</p>\n<p>Alexandria joined the fight, relieving Chevalier, who was on his heels, his blade in rough shape.&#160; A third cape I didn&#8217;t know joined the fight.</p>\n<p>Scion shook off the pair, and then struck Chevalier hard enough to send him crashing into the crowd opposite us.</p>\n<p>Then he wheeled around.&#160; His eyes passed over Acidbath.</p>\n<p>Acidbath, still dancing from foot to foot, leaped, and he changed into a living tidal wave of clear liquid, isolated, with roughly five times his mass.&#160; He materialized into regular human form when he was a little behind and to one side of Scion, and then lashed out, slinging punches that ended with his hands becoming liquid projectiles.&#160; They splashed against Scion, and I could see smoke rise, even though there wasn&#8217;t any visible damage.</p>\n<p>If Scion had been planning to attack us, the cape with Alexandria managed to get his attention.&#160; Another flying bruiser type.&#160; An &#8216;Alexandria package&#8217; cape fighting alongside Alexandria herself.</p>\n<p>Or Pretender, whoever.</p>\n<p>The fear that was emanating from my minions was paralyzing me, I realized.&#160; I shook it off and stepped up the attack.&#160; The one with the shards and the one with the soft looking body charged to either side, and moved right out of my power&#8217;s range.</p>\n<p>I <em>hoped</em> they would take this as a nudge, a push to get back into the thick of things.&#160; Both these capes and the ones around us.&#160; We weren&#8217;t many, but we were a little closer to Scion than most, and we were steadfast.&#160; Capes who were backing away on either side of us were keeping their eyes on Scion, where they might otherwise have routed completely.</p>\n<p>The guy that was made up of fragments took the nudge from me for what it was, giving me a hard look over one shoulder before he joined Alexandria and the other cape in attacking Scion.&#160; He was a shapeshifter, maybe one like Mush, from the Brockton Bay Merchants.&#160; My assessment of his power suggested he was tougher than he looked.</p>\n<p>The other one, with the air swirling beneath his skin, simply left my range and ran.&#160; He found a spot with more capes and slowed down, dropping into a crouch, like he might run at the first opportunity.</p>\n<p>Scion threw the Alexandria-package cape I couldn&#8217;t name into the ceramic shard guy, and he managed to break the cape&#8217;s fall, falling to pieces in the process.&#160; He began picking himself up, gathering more pieces of glass from nearby rubble to make himself bigger than before.</p>\n<p>Acidbath stepped up the attack, slinging acid every time the path was clear,</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t want to lose my stride, getting caught up in observation.&#160; I focused on my minions.&#160; The tinker with the disc had her plants loaded down with drugs.&#160; I focused our attention on different things, and I got more fragmented memories in response.&#160; A glimpse of me, paralyzed, with Bonesaw about to operate on me.</p>\n<p><em>Poison?&#160; Paralytic?</em></p>\n<p>Being inside the building Coil had set on fire.</p>\n<p><em>Incendiary?&#160; Blinding?</em></p>\n<p>The hospital bed-</p>\n<p>I was acting even as the knowledge came to me.&#160; I pushed her to use that one, and the passenger took over.&#160; It was better at understanding the abstracts.&#160; I could follow what it was doing, grasp the basics of it.&#160; Her body and the seat beneath her was another plant, focused on producing, concentrating and storing gases in a combination that served as breathable air, the same gas that was keeping her disc aloft.</p>\n<p>Her hand moved, the raised platforms shifted, and one tree was lowered to a point just in front of her.</p>\n<p>The gas blew what looked like a vast cloud of purple pollen out onto the battlefield.&#160; It settled on the wounded capes, and only the wounded capes.</p>\n<p><em>Coagulants</em>, I thought.&#160; <em>Painkillers.</em></p>\n<p>I watched the others carefully, making sure that my minions weren&#8217;t inadvertently putting others in the line of fire.&#160; I started circling our group with our teleporter, drawing out a line as she jogged in a tight loop.&#160; The two shakers, the telekinetic and the guy who made lasers, they had matching costumes.&#160; Had they combined their techniques?&#160; I formed lasers between the airborne ball bearings.&#160; Needle thin, they still cut into Scion.</p>\n<p>The damage of one with the flexibility of the other.&#160; No doubt a technique they&#8217;d used on their own.</p>\n<p>Scion turned his head, looking at us.&#160; His hands glowed.</p>\n<p>The teleporter lunged forward, completing the loop, leaving out only the brute with the weird skin, the fragment-shapeshifter and the girl with the disc.&#160; I gave one last command to make the disc-botanist tinker start running.</p>\n<p>Our group was collectively teleported away.&#160; I could feel the strength drain out of the teleporter to the point that she fell to the ground.&#160; Scion&#8217;s attention was elsewhere.&#160; He hadn&#8217;t gone after any of the ones we&#8217;d left behind.&#160; We&#8217;d managed to avoid his attentions.</p>\n<p>I turned my attention to the one cape I hadn&#8217;t yet figured out.</p>\n<p>A voice interrupted me.&#160; &#8220;Queen Administrator.&#160; I almost didn&#8217;t recognize you.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Glaistig Uaine</em>.&#160; I didn&#8217;t respond.&#160; My focus was on the young man.&#160; Some kind of trump power, responding to a few glimmers here and there.</p>\n<p>I turned her way.&#160; She was dressed in a complicated dress of green-black ribbons, complete with a hood.&#160; <em>She looks so young</em>.</p>\n<p>I pointed at the cape I was trying to figure out and raised my stump-arm in a shrug.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you want to get a full understanding of your new capabilities, you must figure that out on your own,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;Practice, and it will soon be second nature.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I turned my attention to the cape.&#160; My focus, again, was interrupted by her voice.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I will warn you, do not attempt to usurp me.&#160; If I catch you trying, I will fight you.&#160; I am careful to tend to my flock, and would not have anyone but me handle them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I nodded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Good.&#160; Peace is preferable,&#8221; she said.&#160; We watched Scion unload on another group.</p>\n<p><em>They can&#8217;t stop him with brute strength.&#160; They know it.&#160; Yet they keep coming.&#160; Is it just for the sake of going out with a fight?&#160; The hope of finding some trump card?</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;d stopped capes from running, but the idea wasn&#8217;t to stop <em>retreat</em>.&#160; Retreat was sensible.&#160; I didn&#8217;t want things to devolve into a panicked stampede to get away.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It seems we&#8217;re losing, Administrator,&#8221; Glaistig Uaine said, as if echoing my thoughts.</p>\n<p>I shook my head a little.</p>\n<p><em></em>&#8220;I would offer him solace, if I knew how.&#160; He is in a dangerous state, and I find myself worried for the first time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I glanced at her.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, very worried.&#160; Had things gone like they were before, I would be bothered, but not overly <em>upset</em>.&#160; We would die, the faerie would slumber and they would wait.&#160; With luck, with a <em>great deal </em>of luck,&#160;<em>he</em> would find another partner, or another partner would find him, and things would be set for the great play to start anew, on a fresh stage.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Scion had stopped with the beams and the blasts.&#160; He was throwing punches again, hurling himself into the thickest parts of the crowd.&#160; Nilbog&#8217;s creations were taking the brunt of the attack.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But the faerie are creatures of whimsy, aren&#8217;t they?&#160; Easily influenced by the masks they wear.&#160; It&#8217;s the whole point of them, isn&#8217;t it, Administrator?&#160; It&#8217;s why they <em>are</em>, yes?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I nodded a little.&#160; I could almost see it.</p>\n<p>She nodded a little herself, as if satisfied by my response.&#160; &#8220;<em>He&#8217;s</em> fallen prey to the worst kind of whimsy, a destructive wroth.&#160; He is heartbroken and hopeless, he has lost more than you or I could ever imagine, and he may well leave this stage so ruined that things cannot be salvaged, unless we&#8217;re fortunate enough to get a&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>She trailed off, grasping for a word.</p>\n<p><em>Understudy?</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Fortuitous arrival,&#8221; she said.&#160; She smiled a little.&#160; &#8220;Not very likely.&#160; They litter breadcrumbs in their wake, not to be followed, but so their kin don&#8217;t waste time and effort traveling the same paths.&#160; For another to arrive here, they would need to avoid touching a single crumb, like you or me swimming the length of a river without touching a wave.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Black Kaze had entered the battlefield, backed up by Dragon&#8217;s Teeth.&#160; She disappeared, and then reappeared behind Scion, katana drawn.&#160; A moment passed, and Scion reacted as though he&#8217;d been punched dead center in the chest.</p>\n<p>Not a big reaction, but it was <em>a</em> reaction.</p>\n<p>Black Kaze alternated attacks with Acidbath, very proper, measured in her movements, compared to Acidbath&#8217;s flailing, reckless, hurried scramble to keep out of Scion&#8217;s line of sight.&#160; Acidbath moved with surprising quickness, faster than a typical car might.&#160; A peculiarity of his breaker power.</p>\n<p>Glaistig Uaine offered a small laugh.&#160; &#8220;I cling to a sliver of hope, and I know I&#8217;m fooling myself.&#160; There really isn&#8217;t much of a time window.&#160; A few thousand years is <em>such</em> a short time, you know.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I continued to pay attention while I focused on the more mysterious cape in my range, the one who I hadn&#8217;t deciphered.</p>\n<p>The connections of his powers to something that was there but not quite there&#8230; his power hinged on some outside qualifier or factor that wasn&#8217;t being met on this battlefield.&#160; It was concentrated most on the wounded&#8230;</p>\n<p>It snapped into place.&#160; His power worked with people who were <em>sleeping</em>.&#160; The people his power <em>sort of </em>worked on were unconscious.</p>\n<p>I used the teleporter to draw a circle around him.&#160; A moment later, he was gone, set in the midst of the biggest cluster of wounded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ah, you understood.&#160; Good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Only a moment later, Scion attacked, striking the ground.&#160; We were distant enough that I could see the circle of golden light expanding around them, a ring that ripped through the ground, demolishing it.</p>\n<p>Nilbog&#8217;s creations, the defending forces and Dragon&#8217;s suits were all toppled as the ground settled.&#160; Buildings collapsed.</p>\n<p>A wounded Leviathan emerged from the water, approaching Scion with an almost lazy slowness.&#160; Capes practically fought one another to get their footing and get out of the way.&#160; Some were too rough in their hurry to get by Nilbog&#8217;s creations, only to get attacked by the things in retaliation.</p>\n<p>I clenched my one fist.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Would you accompany me?&#160; We would be the queen of the living and queen of the fallen.&#160; No swords in our hands, but warlords nonetheless.&#160; Yes?&#160; I will give you hints, if you desire them, and help you manage your soldiers.&#160; One last hurrah, a great war to end it all, like the best myths have.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I shook my head slowly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No?&#160; A shame.&#160; Fear?&#160; A lack of soldiers?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I shook my head, still.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, you are not afraid, queen, or you <em>are</em> afraid, but this is a fear that drives you forward.&#160; You have something you intend to do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I nodded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then I will be here when you return, and we can have that great battle, fighting to drive <em>him</em> back into slumber.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I gathered my swarm around me and the teleporter, and I had her draw another circle.</p>\n<p>Glaistig Uaine reached out, seizing the woman&#8217;s wrist.&#160; The teleporter&#8217;s alarm mingled with my own.</p>\n<p>But she wasn&#8217;t attacking, and she wasn&#8217;t taking the teleporter&#8217;s powers, extinguishing her life in the process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A warning,&#8221; Glaistig Uaine said.</p>\n<p>I gave her my full attention.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You sought power, and you lost a portion of yourself in the doing.&#160; Always the case, but it&#8217;s&#8230; pronounced, in a case like yours.&#160; Yes?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hng,&#8221; I mumbled.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You will need a tether, an anchor.&#160; It can be an idea, a physical thing, a place, a person, a goal.&#160; Right now, it will not seem so important, but it <em>will</em>.&#160; When all is said and done, you will either be dead, and this thing will be a comfort to you in your last moments, or you will be powerful, and it will be all you have left.&#160; Decide what you will hold on to.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;ve already decided what that is</em>, I thought.&#160; Since <em>a long time ago</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Choose very carefully,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;Take it from someone who knows.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Then she moved the teleporter&#8217;s hand, closing the circuit.</p>\n<p>The teleporter and I arrived at our destination at the same moment Leviathan crashed into Scion.&#160; Water mingled with the ruined landscape, seeping into cracks, making life just a bit harder for the capes in the center of the disaster area.</p>\n<p>I felt memories stir.&#160; The moment I&#8217;d announced myself as Weaver and heard the howling.</p>\n<p><em>You really have to make this unnecessarily hard, don&#8217;t you</em>?&#160; I thought.&#160; <em>Reminding me that I&#8217;m abandoning them</em>.</p>\n<p>Yes, Rachel and Imp were probably there.&#160; So were the capes I&#8217;d controlled and urged back into the fray.&#160; Maybe they had turned to run at the first opportunity.&#160; Maybe they had been given a chance to reconsider, and were still fighting.</p>\n<p>Maybe I&#8217;d killed them, by denying them the chance to run.</p>\n<p>But I told myself I wasn&#8217;t abandoning them.</p>\n<p>I had a mission, and this was a mission that would take me back to them, after a fashion.&#160; I might never rejoin the group, I was fully aware of what I was getting myself into, but this was for their sake, not <em>despite</em> them.</p>\n<p>That detour was a part of the mission, killing multiple birds with one stone.&#160; Helping to stop the rout, trying to do a little something to keep the fight going, so the capes on the ground could buy time.&#160; Learning about my new ability, testing my ability to accommodate unfamiliar abilities.</p>\n<p>It hadn&#8217;t been planned, so much, but I&#8217;d also had a reminder of something that had slipped my mind.</p>\n<p>Glaistig Uaine was one of my most dangerous enemies at this point.</p>\n<p>Now I was in dire need of information.&#160; Getting that information was a surprising obstacle, considering my inability to communicate.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t <em>ask</em>, couldn&#8217;t whip out my phone and type something into the search bar and wait for it to dig records out of the archives.</p>\n<p>To these ends, I&#8217;d moved us to the edge of the settlement, where six armored suits were deployed and waiting to be sent into the fray.&#160; The Pendragon was one.&#160; Dragon&#8217;s Teeth were scattered throughout the area, many holding what looked like rocket launchers with glass bulbs at the front.</p>\n<p>The teleporter was exhausted from using her ability, and leaned on me as we made our way forwards.</p>\n<p>D.T. officers stepped forward to bar my way.</p>\n<p>Alarm, surprise.&#160; I was momentarily dazed by images of a number of surprise attacks and explosions.&#160; My power had reached them, and they stepped aside at my command.</p>\n<p>I moved as confidently and as quickly towards the Pendragon as I could manage, trying not to show fear or uncertainty.&#160; Harder than it sounded, given my limping, uneven gait, and the way my head slumped forwards.&#160; D.T. officers beyond my range took notice and moved to flank me.</p>\n<p>I reached the back of the Pendragon and I slammed my hand on the metal door.&#160; I did it again.&#160; My best attempt at a knock.&#160; I tried my best to stand straight, folding my hand behind me.</p>\n<p>Not quite loud enough.&#160; The armor was too thick.&#160; Still, the fact that I&#8217;d knocked was a point in my book, as far as the officers were concerned.&#160; They were hanging back.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Defiant isn&#8217;t replying,&#8221; one of the officers said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Try Dragon,&#8221; another spoke.&#160; &#8220;She always answers calls.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ladies!&#8221;&#160; One called out.&#160; &#8220;State your identities for the record!&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>You know who I am</em>, I thought.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know your face, we&#8217;ve met, but we can&#8217;t take anything for granted here!&#160; Stranger and Master protocols are in effect!&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Oh</em>.</p>\n<p>Were the protocols in effect because of me?</p>\n<p>Or was it a problem that stemmed from the half-dozen incidents in the last two years, where people had tried to capitalize on Endbringer attacks and other crises, attempting assassinations on key figures?</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t argue it, in any event.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t defend myself, either.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Both of you!&#160; We&#8217;ll need your names, and we need at least one good password!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Right.&#160; Lovely.</p>\n<p>Couldn&#8217;t use the teleporter without getting shot.&#160; They&#8217;d see the line&#8230;</p>\n<p>Unless they couldn&#8217;t.&#160; Seeing myself through the teleporter&#8217;s eyes, I was a little surprised at the sheer number of bugs I&#8217;d accumulated.</p>\n<p>She moved her hands to me, and she drew the line through the middle of the swarm.</p>\n<p>Could she teleport where she couldn&#8217;t see?</p>\n<p>I focused our attention on the interior of the Pendragon.</p>\n<p>She closed the circuit, and we were inside.</p>\n<p>My bugs could sense the soldiers reacting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Weaver?&#8221;&#160; Dragon asked.&#160; &#8220;I was just about to step outside.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I stepped away from the teleporter.&#160; My eyes roved over the ship&#8217;s interior.&#160; Less elbow room than in the Dragonfly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tattletale filled me in, asked me to pass on the details,&#8221; Dragon said.&#160; &#8220;A lot of people are worried, here, on quite a few different levels.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t respond, and I knew how tight time was, so I met her eyes, nodded a little, and then gestured towards the nearest laptop.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Dragon said.&#160; &#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I gave her a little salute.&#160; I didn&#8217;t know a better way of expressing thanks.&#160; If I&#8217;d known sign language, would I have lost it with my ability to speak and write?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tattletale was saying you were unfocused.&#160; I&#8217;m not getting that sense.&#160; You&#8217;re up to something.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The laptop booted.&#160; I froze.</p>\n<p><em>Oh.&#160; Damn.</em></p>\n<p>I realized what I was looking at, and I felt my heart plummet.</p>\n<p>When my mom had died, I&#8217;d sort of turned to books as a way of remembering her, a way of being with her in the present day, reminding myself of the nights she would read aloud to me, then the nights we&#8217;d read together, and beyond that, times when we&#8217;d all be in the living room, my dad with his computer half the time, a book the other half.&#160; My mom and I always had our novels.&#160; Sometimes we had shared, sometimes not.</p>\n<p>When the bullying had started, books had been an escape.&#160; I&#8217;d be exhausted at the end of the day, feeling a low that counterbalanced the higher adrenaline and stress of the time spent in school.&#160; Curling up with something to read had been a refuge.</p>\n<p>Maybe that had lapsed when I&#8217;d become a cape.&#160; The costumed stuff had become an escape of sorts.&#160; But I&#8217;d gotten back into it in prison, and on some of the stakeouts.&#160; I&#8217;d taught myself braille, so I could read with my bugs, and take in more.</p>\n<p>I would have settled for being a little crazy.&#160; I would have settled for some physical impairment, for a power that was so out of control that I couldn&#8217;t have real human contact again.</p>\n<p>The words were gibberish.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t read.&#160; It had been something I&#8217;d turned to in my lowest moments, a little crutch, a coping mechanism, and it had been denied to me.</p>\n<p>It hit me harder than the loss of my voice, stupid as it was.&#160; My hand shook, hovering over the display.</p>\n<p>I watched as the words disappeared, replaced by images.&#160; A composite picture of locations, a composite picture of faces, a composite picture of icons that no doubt included details on powers.&#160; There were others I could scroll down to see.</p>\n<p>My eyes watered a little.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t look at Dragon, but I raised my hand in another salute.&#160; Not nearly as good a thank-you as I wanted to be able to give.</p>\n<p>My fingers touched the display.&#160; Faces.</p>\n<p>There were sub-menus.&#160; All visual.&#160; I clicked the frowny-face with the black background, then the little map for a world map&#8230; America.&#160; I clicked the map icon again for a national map&#8230; Washington.</p>\n<p>I found Teacher&#8217;s portrait near the top of the results list.&#160; One of Washington&#8217;s most notorious capes.&#160; Right.&#160; I clicked it.</p>\n<p>Dragon&#8217;s hand settled on the top of my head.&#160; She ran it over my hair, using one finger to hook a strand and move it out of my face.&#160; She did the same for another strand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; she asked.</p>\n<p>I opened his file, and I clicked through the tabs until I saw a map.</p>\n<p>I tapped my phone against the screen.</p>\n<p>There was a rumble outside, followed by a thrum, and movement beyond this craft.&#160; Dragon had deployed at least two of the other suits.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I need some communication here, Weaver,&#8221; Dragon said.</p>\n<p>Dumbly, I tapped the phone against the screen once again, not making eye contact.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; she said, but she made it sound like an order.</p>\n<p><em>What do you want?</em>&#160; I thought.&#160; <em>Pantomime?&#160; Do you want me to draw Teacher and the rest with my bugs and enact a play?</em></p>\n<p><em></em>I didn&#8217;t do either.&#160; I reached up and pulled off my mask.&#160; I met Dragon&#8217;s eyes.</p>\n<p>I could see myself through the teleporter&#8217;s vision.&#160; Strands of my hair had fallen across my face as I&#8217;d removed the mask.&#160; My lips were pressed together &#8211; I forced myself to relax them, only to find them resuming the position when I turned my attention elsewhere.&#160; My body was all odd angles, my expression&#8230; I didn&#8217;t even know how to judge my own expression.&#160; I didn&#8217;t know my own face that well, all things considered.&#160; It was only something I saw from time to time in the mirror, getting ready for the day.</p>\n<p>Intense?&#160; Focused?&#160; Determined?</p>\n<p>Fatalistic?&#160; More crazy than less?</p>\n<p>I held her gaze.</p>\n<p>Again, I tapped the phone against the computer screen.</p>\n<p>It chirped.&#160; The data had been loaded onto it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If it was <em>Skitter</em> that asked me, I would have said no,&#8221; Dragon said.</p>\n<p>I nodded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I was convinced it was Weaver in there more than anything else, I&#8217;d feel a lot better about this.&#160; Tell me, am I going to regret giving you this?&#8221; she asked.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t answer.&#160; Not even with a nod or a shake of the head.&#160; I touched the screen again, going back a bit.&#160; Region&#8230; Chinese Union-Imperial.</p>\n<p>C.U.I.</p>\n<p>She knew what I was looking at.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of how we brought the Endbringers in, bullying people into helping, or at least getting them to stop <em>hurting</em>.&#160; Is this going to be a repeat?&#160; Strongarming them?&#160; Using your power?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\n<p>My phone chirped again.</p>\n<p>Others.&#160; More targets.&#160; The Birdcage.</p>\n<p>Another chirp.</p>\n<p>The rest I&#8217;d find on my own, provided all went according to plan.</p>\n<p>I turned to the teleporter, then bowed low.&#160; It wasn&#8217;t because of her culture &#8211; she looked European &#8211; it was because a bow would have to serve as an apology, as much as a salute would have to serve as acknowledgement and thanks.</p>\n<p>I met Dragon&#8217;s eyes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wish you could explain,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m glad I can&#8217;t</em>, I thought.&#160; I turned to leave.</p>\n<p>Glaistig Uaine was one hurdle I&#8217;d have to cross.&#160; Dragon was another.</p>\n<p>If everything went to plan, they were the biggest threats to me.&#160; Scion excepted, of course.</p>\n<p>I left the teleporter behind, making my way outside.&#160; I turned on the flight pack.</p>\n<p>My bugs sensed the teleporter making her exit, drawing a circle around herself and then promptly disappearing.&#160; <em></em>The Pendragon took off a moment later.</p>\n<p>I approached my target.&#160; The Simurgh was flying over a set of hills that would have been the Towers district of Brockton Bay, had we been on Earth Bet.&#160; She was building something.</p>\n<p>The fighting was ongoing, with Leviathan more hurt than alive.&#160; Capes were fighting to get to safety rather than trying to hurt Scion.</p>\n<p>Scion hit Leviathan, and the last buildings in the settlement toppled.</p>\n<p>I turned away.&#160; I wasn&#8217;t one for prayer, but I wasn&#8217;t really one for <em>hope</em>, either.</p>\n<p>At the same time, though, everything hinged on their ability to hold out.&#160; Scion might leave soon, moving on to another target, but I wasn&#8217;t so sure these guys would be able to hold out against one more attack.</p>\n<p>I passed beside the Simurgh as I flew.&#160; Checking.</p>\n<p><em>No control.</em></p>\n<p>I plummeted.</p>\n<p>The Simurgh, for the time being, came part and parcel with Tattletale.&#160; When she wasn&#8217;t fighting, she was a distance away from my teammate and friend.</p>\n<p>I touched ground, then flew through the doorway at an upward angle, moving over the defensive line Marquis had set at the doorway.</p>\n<p>I found myself back in Tattletale&#8217;s company.&#160; Marquis and Lung were close, but not so close they were in my range.&#160; Panacea and Bonesaw, for their parts, were tending to the wounded.&#160; The two girls froze as they fell inside my range.</p>\n<p>Too many patients, on top of Panacea and Bonesaw.</p>\n<p>Marquis and Tattletale froze as well, but it wasn&#8217;t the same kind of freezing.&#160; It was tension.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Marquis said.</p>\n<p>I ignored him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My daughter-&#8221;</p>\n<p>Panacea stood up.&#160; Bonesaw followed soon after.&#160; They marched in Marquis&#8217; direction.</p>\n<p>They passed out of my range.&#160; Marquis draped an arm around his daughter&#8217;s shoulders, hugging her closer.&#160; Bonesaw wheeled on me, and there was a fury in her eyes.</p>\n<p>It left only the wounded in my vicinity, along with a handful of others.&#160; Members of the backline, the infrastructure elements in Gimel.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Taylor-&#8221; Tattletale said.</p>\n<p>I ignored her too.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sort of getting what you&#8217;re doing.&#160; I don&#8217;t get <em>why</em>, but I think I get what you&#8217;re about to do.&#160; Don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I closed my eyes, concentrating.&#160; I needed to figure this out before I made any moves, or I&#8217;d be putting myself in danger.&#160; Problem was&#8230; there was so <em>much</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Taylor, if you go ahead with this, and people start to catch on, you become public enemy number two.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Catch on?&#8221; Marquis asked.</p>\n<p>Tattletale didn&#8217;t answer him.</p>\n<p>I was pretty sure I had it.</p>\n<p>With my power, I seized control of Doormaker and the Clairvoyant.&#160; The pair stood, holding hands.</p>\n<p>A heartbeat later, a cage of bone erupted from the ground.&#160; Bindings wound around my legs.</p>\n<p><em>He laid a trap under the surface of the ground</em>, I thought.</p>\n<p>Some of the more mobile injured were backing away from me and my two hostages.&#160; The remainder were still in my range.</p>\n<p>Bone coffins encased each of them, sealing them to the ground, out of sight.</p>\n<p>I paused, doing my best to get a sense of them.&#160; I could get the gist of their abilities, focus to try and piece together the details.&#160; There were a few capes who could have broken free, a few who were probably capable of slipping out one way or another.</p>\n<p>But I didn&#8217;t need to go that far.</p>\n<p>I exerted Doormaker&#8217;s power, and he opened a portal behind Marquis.&#160; The other side of that portal was just behind me.</p>\n<p>Memories hit me.&#160; Being chained to the interrogation chamber, opposite Director Tagg.</p>\n<p>Tempered confidence, even now?</p>\n<p>The memories were distorted, moving just a little too quickly towards the end of <em>that</em> particular scenario.&#160; Except I was looking an awful lot like the person on the receiving end of the abrupt, painful and unexpected murdering.</p>\n<p>Marquis&#8217; lieutenants approached.&#160; Cinderhands, Spruce, one other I couldn&#8217;t name, in dark clothes and chains.&#160; Lung was circling around, getting ready to fling a fireball.</p>\n<p>I used Marquis&#8217; power to block their paths with spiked barriers of bone.&#160; When Lung, Spruce and Cinderhands <em>all</em> tore through the barriers, with claw, some sort of disintegration power and flame, respectively, I used Doormaker&#8217;s power again.&#160; This time, the portals I opened were only about a foot by a foot across.&#160; Four at once.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Taylor,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;re putting me in a pretty shitty spot, here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I checked my phone, tabbing through the pages that had been loaded onto it.&#160; There was a blip marking Teacher&#8217;s location.</p>\n<p>More were gathering around me.&#160; I made more doors.&#160; One or two dodged out of the way.&#160; I managed to catch them, anyways.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not getting enough details here to paint a picture.&#160; I trust the hell out of you, but I&#8217;m not sure this <em>is</em> you, Taylor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I pocketed my phone, then reached into my belt.&#160; I hesitated for an instant, then pressed my hand to my chest for long seconds.&#160; I knew I didn&#8217;t have time to spare, but&#8230;&#160; no.&#160; I didn&#8217;t have time to spare.</p>\n<p>I opened a portal twenty feet above Tattletale, then opened my hand.&#160; The little tube of pepper spray dropped through the portal.&#160; Tattletale caught it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have made it easy?&#8221;&#160; Tattletale asked, looking down at it.&#160; &#8220;Because standing by while you do this&#8230; that&#8217;s fucking <em>hard</em>.&#160; It&#8217;s honestly easier if I&#8217;m on <em>their</em> side and I&#8217;m helping them stop you.&#160; If I can blame the fuck-up job Panacea did to your head.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t have a response to that.&#160; I used Marquis&#8217; power to withdraw the bone cage and free my own legs.</p>\n<p>I opened a doorway and passed through.</p>\n<p>Dragon might be my enemy the moment she got filled in on what I was doing, but she was someone I cared about.&#160; Teacher had fucked with her.</p>\n<p>This next bit was going to be easier.</p>\n'<h1 id="chap2">Speck 30.3</h1>b'<p>I made my way into Brockton Bay, the Boardwalk.&#160; Five more steps carried me into New Delhi.&#160; Only a minute later, I was walking through Brockton Bay again, downtown this time.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Bucharest.</p>\n<p>Brockton Bay again.</p>\n<p>Madison, Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>Cauldron&#8217;s Headquarters.</p>\n<p>Ruins.&#160; Places built up by man, painstaking, sometimes over <em>centuries</em>.&#160; Layer upon layer of human experience, history, and art, represented in stone and wood and glass.&#160; Every single building had been put together with the idea of meeting some specific goal, a specific individual&#8217;s tastes, filling a purpose as an institution, or being built to cater to society&#8217;s tastes as a whole.&#160; Virtually every building had been a familiar place to <em>someone</em>, a home, a place of business.&#160; Roads had once been a part of people&#8217;s daily routines, bridges a convenience that was appreciated, if rarely acknowledged.</p>\n<p>Shattered, eroded, dashed aside.&#160; Roads were now uneven slabs, rising and falling, while buildings had folded or leaned over, spilling out their innards.&#160; Those same innards hinted at just how much value we&#8217;d put into this world we&#8217;d built around ourselves.</p>\n<p>I realized I&#8217;d stopped walking, struck by what I was looking at.&#160; There was a tightness in my chest, and I struggled to put my finger on what to call it.&#160; It was a sweet feeling, but not a pleasant one.&#160; Not nostalgia, but it called to a certain kind of familiarity.</p>\n<p><em>Home</em>, I thought.&#160; <em>This is home.</em>&#160; Not so much a place I could return to for a hug, to kick my shoes off and let down my guard, not a place where I would sleep and wake up feeling warm.&#160; Yet it was a place which was central to me, a place I was rooted in, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d defined myself in places like these.&#160; The height of my growth, my strongest moments, they&#8217;d taken place in open graveyards and the aftermath of tragedies.&#160; Not my best moments, not the noblest, but the moments where I&#8217;d had the greatest impacts and had made the choices that shaped who I was.</p>\n<p>I started walking again.&#160; I wasn&#8217;t actually traveling to Brockton Bay, to Bucharest or Los Angeles.&#160;&#160;I <em>could have</em>, but I wasn&#8217;t.&#160; It was only that the ruins here were so easy to relate to those places, to this <em>home</em>.&#160; The memories of the locations were bleeding into my awareness, making it feel almost real.</p>\n<p>I wanted to tell myself it was the clairvoyant in my range, but I couldn&#8217;t quite bring myself to.&#160; I wanted to say it was the distraction of having to devote a small share of my attention to ensuring that Doormaker kept opening portals when the clairvoyant recognized someone asking for one.</p>\n<p>With a note of desperation, I told myself it was because I was still trying to keep tabs on my power, gauge my level of control, and manage my body.&#160; If I couldn&#8217;t get a better grip on my own movements, maybe I could get control over my swarm.&#160; Over the people I was controlling.</p>\n<p>But I didn&#8217;t really believe it.&#160; I was <em>slipping</em>.</p>\n<p>My bugs spilled out over the ruins.&#160; My range was shorter, but I could use the relay bugs I had on hand.</p>\n<p><em>Slipping</em>, the thought came back to me.</p>\n<p>Losing my mind, losing grip on things.</p>\n<p>The Faerie Queen had told me I needed to anchor myself.&#160; Except I&#8217;d been doing that for a long time.&#160; It was how I functioned.&#160; Compartmentalizing, identifying a priority, devoting myself to it.&#160; Surviving the bullying, the mission to turn in the Undersiders, the mission to save Dinah, to turn the city around, to save the world.&#160; I&#8217;d had tunnel vision at the best of times, and I&#8217;d had both successes and failures.</p>\n<p>I functioned best when I had a mission, something beyond the one singular goal before me.&#160; Yes, stopping Scion was key, but-</p>\n<p>I shook my head.&#160; I&#8217;d stopped walking again.&#160; Had to focus.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d use smaller anchors here, smaller things to tie myself down to reality, focusing on my surroundings.&#160; If and when the time came, I would abandon them, cast them away in order of size and priority.&#160; In a way, it would let me gauge how badly I was slipping.</p>\n<p>An exercise of Doormaker&#8217;s power let me experiment with the portals.&#160; They couldn&#8217;t move or drift, excepting the way they were anchored to the rotation of the planet as a whole.&#160; Instead, I opened and closed new portals, timing it so the opening of one was a fraction of a second before the prior one closed.&#160; I surrounded myself with them, a shifting, shuttering array of portals.</p>\n<p>I was put in mind of the moment I donned my costume, of being Skitter the Warlord, with her half-cape, half-shawl.&#160; There had been a kind of power to the gesture, to draping myself in the cloth and assuming the title and the role.</p>\n<p>As I made my way through New York, I found myself altering the portals, reconfiguring them.&#160; I&#8217;d drape myself in them like I did in a costume.</p>\n<p>They formed a loose three-quarter circle around me, Doormaker and the clairvoyant, at first, a cylinder with an opening in front of me.&#160; When I turned my head, they reconfigured, the portals in my way disappearing, replaced by others.</p>\n<p>To streamline the portal creation, I layered them.&#160; Two half-circles, overlapping.</p>\n<p>And then, because it was the most compact way to fit the portals together, because I needed to make a <em>signature, </em> to make this <em>mine</em> and to make it <em>me</em>, I made them hexagons.&#160; A honeycomb interlocking of small, one-foot-diameter doorways, opening up to random points throughout the city, extending my range further than even my bugs could manage.&#160; Each one showed a different image when looked through, a wall, a section of overcast sky, a bit of pavement.&#160; It didn&#8217;t stand out, serving more as a kind of camouflage.</p>\n<p>As I experimented, finding the places to set the portals, my awareness of the city expanded in turn.</p>\n<p>I sensed some of Teacher&#8217;s squads.&#160; Groups of men and women, always with at least one person who was more fit than the rest, all dressed in white, or at least in white shirts with jeans.&#160; Most had backpacks, and all had weapons.&#160; They patrolled, scouting the area, talking amongst each other in low voices.</p>\n<p>Always talking about business.</p>\n<p>I found Teacher.&#160; He had a project in the works, and his &#8216;students&#8217; were busy scavenging.&#160; A different sort of control than I had, with my bugs or the people in my sway.&#160; More <em>human</em>, maybe.&#160; A society, rather than an army of troops gathered in formations.</p>\n<p>The vast majority were active, each with a job to do, a task.&#160; Men carried metal and electronics and either broke down materials or shaped them.&#160; Women, just a little weaker in terms of physical strength, carried things like wire and baskets of clothing they had looted from stores.&#160; Children handled the finer work, etching designs into metal and stitching.</p>\n<p>I could almost respect it.&#160; Except his motives were clearly selfish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Better to be fast than perfect,&#8221; he was saying.&#160; He paused to touch one of his subjects for a few seconds.&#160; The girl stood there, eyes closed, while Teacher resumed talking, &#8220;Follow the blue prints, or use the hub stations to get a clear mental picture.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There were nods from the group around him.</p>\n<p>Hub stations.&#160; Not everyone was active.&#160; There were clusters of two or three individuals that were each together, but I was pretty sure they weren&#8217;t what he was referring to.&#160; There were also some individuals that seemed to be operating as rally points for the others, arranged in a loose ring around their work in progress.&#160; I watched one individual bring a car door to the rally point, touch the man in the center, and then make their way over to teacher.&#160; He murmured, &#8220;Metal and fiberglass design.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Teacher touched him for four seconds, and then the man with the door made his way to a table, dropping a backpack and collecting a small crowbar.&#160; As he started working, another man at the table stretched, grabbed a backpack, then joined one of the scavenging groups.</p>\n<p>It was like a barn raising, but they were working purely in steel and electronics. Individuals that were tired switched to a different job, and everyone worked tirelessly.</p>\n<p>They were building a Dragon-craft from scratch.</p>\n<p>Not only a Dragon-craft.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Eight costumes,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; He approached a table, lifting one costume off the surface to investigate.&#160; &#8220;Not so flashy.&#160; We want to fly under the radar.&#160; Make it substandard, if anything.&#160; C-list material.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There were nods all around.&#160; Teacher walked over to another table, lined with tinker weaponry and other tools.&#160; His students were loyal, but they weren&#8217;t <em>puppets</em>, like mine were.&#160; Their movements were natural.&#160; The overall <em>system</em>, though, wasn&#8217;t natural at all.</p>\n<p>I was put in mind of Regent&#8217;s games.&#160; There was the base of operations, the cluster of villagers managing the city, and there were the more independent squads of people, deployed to the world beyond the base camp, patrolling for enemies, ready at a moment&#8217;s notice to be gathered together in a massed attack.</p>\n<p>No doubt they were organized by ability.&#160; Teacher could grant thinker and tinker powers.&#160; If I assumed at least one tinker per group, with the tinkers carrying some ranged weapon or defense, and if the athletic members of the roaming squads were the soldiers, gifted with some knowledge that would give them a small edge in a fight, there were still two or three members in a given group I couldn&#8217;t identify.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t even finished the thought when one of them perked up, startled.&#160; She shouted, &#8220;Scatter!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Her group moved in different directions.</p>\n<p>Trouble?</p>\n<p><em>I </em>was the trouble.&#160; <em>It&#8217;s a fucking precog.</em></p>\n<p>I opened portals, catching her three teammates, one by one.</p>\n<p>It took two tries to catch her.&#160; She was a fast runner, and she saw where I was putting down my portal before I&#8217;d even started, turning a hundred and eighty degrees around and scrambling in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>They were eerily calm, all things considered, much like Doormaker and the clairvoyant.&#160; It made things easier for me.&#160; But I knew that &#8216;easy&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t last.</p>\n<p>Teacher achieved control over people by giving them parahuman abilities.&#160; The organization was important, and everything was key.&#160; I&#8217;d moved too fast, and now Teacher&#8217;s human systems were starting to kick into effect.</p>\n<p>Men and women in an isolated cluster dropped to their knees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Amber district, team B-six,&#8221; one of the students in the group reported.&#160; His voice was as clear as a bell in the near-silence of Teacher&#8217;s base of operations.&#160; There were only the sounds of tools and the steady percussion of hammers striking metal, all in unison.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the problem?&#8221;&#160; Teacher asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Out of action.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Change focus.&#160; All observation teams, identify our target,&#8221; Teacher said.</p>\n<p>Heads in every second group around the base turned.&#160; They looked my way, as if they could see the full five or six city blocks and see me standing in the middle of the road.</p>\n<p>One crossed to another group, touching a young man.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Weaver,&#8221; the young man said, in turn.</p>\n<p><em>It&#8217;s like a computer.&#160; Every person carries out a specific operation, and they&#8217;re gathered in clusters with people who can communicate those ideas to others in efficient ways</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tinker group H,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; &#8220;Defensive measures, modify them for micro-scale drones.&#160; Forcefields, area attacks.&#160; Group N, to me.&#160; We&#8217;ll need more tinkers on this problem.&#160; We&#8217;ll also need to this area.&#160; Groups F and J, I&#8217;ll recalibrate, put you on more general anti-clairvoyance duty.&#160; She&#8217;s- You&#8217;re looking in, aren&#8217;t you, Weaver?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I reached out to place a portal in Teacher&#8217;s camp, right behind him.&#160; I hit a barrier, a dead zone I couldn&#8217;t affect.</p>\n<p>Some tinker device was blocking my clairvoyant, which was blocking Doormaker in turn.</p>\n<p>My relay bugs didn&#8217;t work either.&#160; They only worked on bugs.</p>\n<p>I began laying down portals around the perimeter, instead, finding the exact point I could affect.&#160; The portals right next to me were turned around, so none faced me directly.&#160; It wouldn&#8217;t do if he had students open fire and shoot through the portal to hit me point blank.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is new,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; &#8220;Have I done something to earn your attention?&#160; Crossed a line, somehow, maybe I inadvertently borrowed someone you care about?&#160; I assure you, I&#8217;m very benign.&#160; The <em>vast</em> majority of my students here volunteered their services.&#160; I told them I could use them to help stop Scion and save the world, and they agreed.&#160; A number of others took the deal with the oath that I could borrow them for a year, and I&#8217;d supply them powers with no strings attached for the extent of their lives, no mental bondage at all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I frowned, shifting my weight from foot to foot, trying to ensure I didn&#8217;t lose touch with my body.&#160; If I had to move, I wanted to be able to move fast.</p>\n<p>One of the groups was close enough to the perimeter of Teacher&#8217;s base to fall in range of my portal.&#160; I seized them, then took a second to analyze their capabilities.&#160; Hyper-acute senses, enhanced aim, the ability to see through walls and a danger sense.</p>\n<p>I thought of Tattletale, boasting to Coil in the moments before I&#8217;d pulled the trigger.</p>\n<p><em>Not,</em> I reminded myself, <em>that I&#8217;m pulling any triggers here.</em></p>\n<p>But I needed to disturb things, shake up Teacher&#8217;s elegantly balanced operation.</p>\n<p>They looked at one another, and I gauged the equipment they held.&#160; The one with enhanced aim was the &#8216;soldier&#8217; of the group, armed with an ordinary gun and a bandolier of grenades.</p>\n<p>I controlled his movements, directing him to grab a grenade from the bandolier.&#160; He handed it over to the one with enhanced senses.</p>\n<p>The one with the grenade raised his hand, hollering, leaning back, ready to throw-</p>\n<p>My danger-detector reacted, and I had Doormaker create a portal, moving the grenade out of the line of fire.&#160; A fat blob of crackling energy soared through the vacated space.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re full of surprises today,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m going to assume this is actually you, Weaver, and that you&#8217;re not an Ingenue thrall or something similar.&#160; I want you to know I&#8217;m not your enemy.&#160; I was there for that whole business against the Elite, pitting Endbringers on them, I understand <em>why</em> you did it.&#160; You have your mission, a noble task, and you see it as a <em>universal </em>task.&#160; One everyone should inspire towards.&#160; Peace and prosperity in your territory, because peace and prosperity are good things, am I right?&#160; Please feel free to comment, strike up a conversation here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He gestured, and his crowd of students collectively backed away from the squad of students I&#8217;d taken over at one corner of his setup.&#160; They faced down the others, their heads and shoulders visible above a section of wall that had fallen to the road hours ago.&#160; I watched his group move, and tried Doormaker&#8217;s power again.&#160; The borders were at the same points.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No?&#160; Okay.&#160; You&#8217;ll have to trust me when I say I&#8217;m working towards the same end mission you are.&#160; I want to stop Scion.&#160; But I&#8217;m not a warrior, and I&#8217;d be offering more trouble than help if I was on the battlefield.&#160; My students are fine when I&#8217;m giving the orders, but they&#8217;re prone to undecision at key junctions.&#160; I know where I need to be, I&#8217;ll be there shortly, and I&#8217;ll be of far more use to our side then.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If the group had moved and the borders were at the same point, then it wasn&#8217;t a <em>person </em>generating the effect.</p>\n<p>I used my bugs and Doormaker&#8217;s power to get a sense of where the perimeter of this clairvoyance-blocking power was.&#160; It was just a little irregularly shaped, but I could factor buildings and intervening obstacles into the area.&#160; If there was a generated signal, it didn&#8217;t extend as far with solid objects in the way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the books, I was inviting you to ask where it is I was planning on going.&#160; You seem more keen on silence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>My squad turned a gun on the very center point, opening fire with a trio of bullets.</p>\n<p>A box, a tinker-made device, exploded in sparks, popping into the air and bouncing off of the pavement.</p>\n<p>I tested the clairvoyant&#8217;s power.&#160; It worked.</p>\n<p>I placed portals with care.&#160; Not to ensnare Teacher&#8217;s students, but to cut them off.&#160; Portals between them, above and behind them, in front.&#160; Assuming twelve to thirteen feet of range, I could space them out and cover a wide area.</p>\n<p>When I started tagging the groups, I worked from the outside in.&#160; His precogs weren&#8217;t amazing, with only a few seconds of awareness before their power gave them a heads up, but the trap was already in place.</p>\n<p>I left Teacher for last.&#160; No students at his disposal.&#160; I made a portal, and then stepped through.&#160; My soldiers aimed guns at him, while others stood stock still.</p>\n<p>Teacher said something in a language I didn&#8217;t understand.</p>\n<p>I shook my head.&#160; I didn&#8217;t have a better way of showing my lack of understanding.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; he asked, smiling a little.</p>\n<p>I shook my head once more.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A shame, that,&#8221; he said.&#160; He sounded genuinely bothered.</p>\n<p>My bugs flowed over him and through his pockets.&#160; I didn&#8217;t have silk, so I used thread from one of the workbenches, encircling the gun beneath his unfashionable corduroy jacket.&#160; It wasn&#8217;t a fast process, but Teacher saw what I was doing and helped it along, raising his hands to his head, simultaneously lifting his jacket up and away from the weapon.</p>\n<p>I passed the thread to one of my new underlings, and they pulled the gun free.</p>\n<p>My new minions began examining the gathered components and gear.&#160; I looked through their eyes, taking it all in.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not <em>unfamiliar</em> with robbery,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; &#8220;Parcel and part of this whole enterprise.&#160; But this isn&#8217;t you, I don&#8217;t think.&#160; For one thing, I&#8217;m working towards stopping Scion, in a roundabout way.&#160; Or mollifying the damage he does, if stopping him isn&#8217;t likely.&#160; It seems things have turned around, then, if you&#8217;re closer to being the Elite you were so recently condemning, and I&#8217;m someone working towards a fix.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I gave him a hard look.&#160; He shrugged, his hands still on his head, then said something in another language, smiling a little.</p>\n<p>A code word?&#160; A trap or trigger for some tinker device hereabouts?</p>\n<p>Except nothing had happened.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well then,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;Scratch that.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>He tried something and it didn&#8217;t work?&#160; </em>My swarm shifted their stances, approaching a little closer, guns raised.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Definitely</em> scratch that,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;Well then, I won&#8217;t ask for your forgiveness, but I can still be blunt.&#160; You seem different, and not so much for the better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>My attention was on the tables.&#160; Weapons, tinker gear&#8230; I started browsing through it myself, joining the minions who weren&#8217;t actively keeping Teacher at gunpoint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Can I ask <em>why</em>?&#160; Or is that too personal?&#160; I understand second triggers can be mortifying.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I turned around to face him.&#160; I put my hand flat against my mouth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mute.&#160; I see.&#160; And you came to me for help with that?&#160; Do you want to be able to communicate again?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re looking to refine this ability of yours.&#160; I can do that.&#160; Give capes control over abilities that feel a little lacking in areas.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Again, I shook my head.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What did you come for, then?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t respond, my attention on the group.</p>\n<p>I found what I was looking for.</p>\n<p>Boxes, small, with a single, broad button along one side.&#160; Like detonators.&#160; There was nothing to them but a single LED, green, and a few ports where they could be plugged into certain ports or outlets.</p>\n<p>I gathered them, tucking them into spare pouches.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you could sock one for me?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I shook my head.&#160; I gathered all of them.</p>\n<p>Then I began gathering the guns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is inconvenient, for the books.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>You don&#8217;t need these against Scion</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Again, my power <em>is</em> available, if you should need it.&#160; Anything that helps against our reciprocal enemy, you understand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He had an annoying habit of picking difficult-sounding words and using them instead of simpler options.&#160; Like someone trying to sound smarter than they were.</p>\n<p>I approached Teacher.&#160; I saw him startle a little at the sudden movement.</p>\n<p>He had nowhere to run, and he knew it.&#160; He looked around, and he could see his own students caught in my snare.</p>\n<p>I saw the surrender in his body language, an instant before he fell inside my power&#8217;s range.</p>\n<p>Memories hit me.&#160;<em> Announcing myself as Weaver in front of the PRT building</em>.&#160; <em>Taking on the role in New Delhi, coordinating two teams</em>.</p>\n<p>I could sense his power, and I could sense his general awareness of the people he&#8217;d affected.&#160; There was no constant connection between him and them, nothing like I had over my bugs or my subjects.</p>\n<p>I moved another over to him, and I used his power on them.</p>\n<p>There was a connection <em>then</em>.&#160; It only took a little bit of time, and focus on Teacher&#8217;s part.&#160; I could sense both the power taking hold, and the <em>frailty</em>, the weak point that manifested at the same time.&#160; There was a duality.</p>\n<p>I let go of the subject, and I could feel that frail point linger, decaying by the smallest fraction with every passing moment.&#160; <em>That</em> was what Teacher sensed, an awareness of both the power and the degree of influence he had over the subject.</p>\n<p><em>No, </em>I thought.&#160; <em>Not an option</em>.</p>\n<p>I withdrew my phone, unlocked it, and found the page I needed.&#160; I threw it to Teacher.&#160; Rather than try to catch it with his clumsier movements, I had him grab the bottom of his sweater and lift it up, forming a net.&#160; It landed in the &#8216;net&#8217;, and Teacher collected it.</p>\n<p>I backed away, releasing him.</p>\n<p>Teacher staggered a little, then muttered what must have been a swear word in that other language.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Karma, I suppose,&#8221; he said, panting a little.&#160; &#8220;A&#8230; little nerve wracking there.&#160; I can&#8217;t help but notice you didn&#8217;t pursue with yourself, while you had me in command.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There would be no way to use the power without leaving myself open to Teacher&#8217;s influence.&#160; No, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to get myself a voice this way.&#160; Not if it affected my ability to make decisions.&#160; Not if it left a lingering window open.</p>\n<p>These people who&#8217;d taken his promise of a lifetime of power, no strings attached, had been misled.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nothing, then?&#8221; he asked.</p>\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A disappointment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t <em>that</em> disappointed.&#160; I had what I needed.&#160; A speed bump for Scion, weapons, a little more information on how my power worked, and&#8230;&#160; I pointed at the phone I&#8217;d given him.&#160; He glanced down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The C.I.U.,&#8221; Teacher said.</p>\n<p>I responded with a short nod, then held up one of the devices I&#8217;d collected.&#160; I was picking and choosing the members of Teacher&#8217;s collection I could use, arming them with tinker weaponry and gathering them near me.&#160; I didn&#8217;t enclose them in my little cloak of portals.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; you guessed?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I nodded, once.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Understand, it wasn&#8217;t spiteful on my part,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; He lapsed into the other language for one moment, &#8220;&#8230;I gave them the switch in the hopes it would stop the incursions and curb honestly.&#160; They were supposed to lock themselves away, but they held on to it, apparently intending to use it if anyone retaliated.&#160; An ingress, a portcullis, if you will.&#160; A way to raise the drawbridge and prevent passage into their castle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At my order, some of his students gestured with their guns, prompting him.</p>\n<p>He seemed to take the threat in stride.&#160; &#8220;The one with a white button.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I glanced at the ones in my possession.&#160; I found it in a belt pouch and repositioned it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Skeleton key, Weaver.&#160; I could make you force me to give up any of this detail, but I won&#8217;t.&#160; I want to get back to work, so I can <em>help</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He was giving me a funny look, trying to drive home his point.</p>\n<p>But this was a roundabout plan, some kind of infiltration, and he was clearly working <em>against</em> our side.&#160; I wasn&#8217;t sure I bought it.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t matter.</p>\n<p>I gestured to the phone.&#160; He moved to throw it back, and I raised a hand.&#160; I pointed to my left.</p>\n<p>He wasn&#8217;t stupid.&#160; He got my meaning, then used the phone to find the page I was referring to.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I assume you&#8217;re not looking to find <em>me, </em>which leaves only the Birdcage.&#160; No.&#160; I haven&#8217;t provided any devices to the Birdcage, or anyone alleged with it.&#160; But you&#8217;re going to find entering is difficult, regardless.&#160; There <em>are</em> security placements in measure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I nodded.&#160; My soldiers got in place, rank and file around me, all armed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I grasp your intentions, Weaver, I can speculate you&#8217;ll be back for me later?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t respond.&#160; No need to telegraph my plans to Teacher.&#160; Still, the thinkers were figuring out what I was up to.</p>\n<p>I was running out of time.</p>\n<p>Which meant taking a leap of faith.</p>\n<p>Using the clairvoyant directly was a dangerous prospect.&#160; He could grant the power to see the entire world, multiple worlds, but <em>breaking </em>that contact was troubling, debilitating.&#160; I could see the toll it had already taken on Doormaker.</p>\n<p>But I couldn&#8217;t afford to hold back.</p>\n<p>I separated Doormaker from his partner.&#160; I could sense the effect, the sensory shift, the break in perspective, the mild nausea.&#160; But he was functionally blind and deaf, and there were only so many senses that he had which could suffer.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d suffer far, far more.&#160; If I made contact with the clairvoyant and was forced to break it&#8230; that would be it.&#160; Chances were good I wouldn&#8217;t be able to carry on.&#160; Things would be over before I recovered.</p>\n<p>I took stock.&#160; I had a squadron, now.&#160; People who would have been slaves anyways.&#160; People with simple abilities that were easy to get a handle on and use.&#160; I had weapons, better than a typical gun.</p>\n<p>Hopefully we wouldn&#8217;t have to use them.</p>\n<p>I took hold of Doormaker&#8217;s hand, and I moved it to my belt, hooking his fingers through it.&#160; Then I used my hand to take hold of the clairvoyant&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>My awareness started to unfold.&#160; A slow, steady, gradual process.&#160; I was aware of vast tracts of land.&#160; I could see the damage done to Earth Bet.&#160; It disoriented me, to see how we were in Washington, not New York.&#160; Teacher had returned home.&#160; Why had I thought we were in New York?</p>\n<p>If I&#8217;d been distant from myself before, the enhanced vision made it that much worse.</p>\n<p>I could remember how I&#8217;d once been <em>comforted</em> by the fact that my power put the world in perspective, showing me just how small I was in the grand scheme of things.</p>\n<p>This wasn&#8217;t comforting at all.&#160; Not this.&#160; Not at this brutal<em> scale</em>.&#160; I could sense the entirety of the world, from atmosphere to ocean floor.&#160; I could, if I wanted to listen for it, hear the wind, the patter of rain, see the shimmers of heat on one side of the planet and the frost forming in caves on the other side of the planet, day and night at the same time.</p>\n<p><em>I can see how the Doctor got a little detached from things, if she used this power with any regularity</em>.</p>\n<p>Teacher said something.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t make it out, because I wasn&#8217;t really listening.</p>\n<p>I could see the other worlds and tally up the damage.&#160; Not even a fifth of us were fighting, but those ten percent were giving it their all.&#160; Others had retreated, finding family or friends to take shelter with.</p>\n<p>I could count all of the individual collections of people.&#160; Using Doormaker, the Doctor had scattered mankind over every available earth.&#160; Collections of a few hundred to a few thousand.&#160; People used to civilized life were starting over from scratch.&#160; Makeshift shelters, fires, crafting tools.&#160; They were tired, frustrated, and above all else, they were scared.&#160; There was no news, no media, no way to follow the ongoing fight.</p>\n<p>When I stopped looking, they didn&#8217;t <em>leave</em> my attention.&#160; They carried on in my peripheral vision, as that field of vision continued to grow with every passing second.</p>\n<p>The only real limitation was a set of blind spots, identical to the one that had hovered over Teacher&#8217;s base of operations.&#160; I could work around that.&#160; There was also the fact that I could <em>avoid </em>looking for things, and keep them out of sight.&#160; I could avoid searching and seeking, avoid bringing something or someone into my field of vision.</p>\n<p>Another anchor, another thing to tie me to reality, tie me to <em>Taylor</em>.</p>\n<p>I could see one cabin, off in the distance in Earth Gimel.&#160; It would be three days of walking on foot to get there from the settlement.</p>\n<p>Grue&#8217;s cabin.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m so weak, </em>I thought.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t want to look inside and see him with Cozen.&#160; I didn&#8217;t want to see them curled up in front of a fire, knowing the world could end at any moment, should Scion decide to shatter the landmass.</p>\n<p>Instead, I fixed that cabin&#8217;s location in mind, and I watched it from a distance.</p>\n<p>I found my house, or what little was left of it, in shattered Brockton Bay.</p>\n<p>I found <em>people</em>.&#160; I found Charlotte and Forrest.&#160; I found Sierra, being very authoritarian and intimidating as she ordered refugees around.&#160; She gave off an oddly familiar impression.</p>\n<p>I found Tattletale.&#160; She&#8217;d left her laptop aside and was helping with the wounded, talking with Rachel and Panacea in an intense, low voice.</p>\n<p>Imp was giving somebody CPR.&#160; Unlike the movies, most CPR attempts weren&#8217;t successful.&#160; Her patient was probably dead already, but she kept trying.&#160; Ages ago, Grue hadn&#8217;t been able to get her to take the first aid class.</p>\n<p>Parian and Foil were moving around the outskirts of the battlefield, riding a stuffed animal.&#160; Foil wasn&#8217;t shooting, and it wasn&#8217;t due to a lack of ammunition.</p>\n<p>All the people I cared about, the things I wanted to hold on to, no matter what.</p>\n<p>I found my mom&#8217;s grave.&#160; It was a part of the ruined landscape, and the earth had cracked open.&#160; I could see the insect life surrounding the site.&#160; Experimentally, I opened a portal.&#160; My relay bugs passed through, and I cleared up the area, bringing the bugs to me.</p>\n<p>Vanity, stupidity, but I felt a little better.&#160; The area was cleaner.&#160; Still in ruins, but cleaner.</p>\n<p>And my dad&#8230;</p>\n<p>I hesitated.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;ve lost so much</em>, I thought.&#160; <em>Forgive me, dad.&#160; I need to have the hope you&#8217;re still alive more than I need to know either way.</em></p>\n<p>I exhaled slowly.</p>\n<p>Little anchors, more things to tie me down to reality.&#160; I double checked the others were in place.&#160; The least important of all, the mantle, the <em>costume</em>, for lack of a better word, with the honeycombed portals, it was secure.&#160; I had my goal, I had my mission.</p>\n<p>I was still <em>me</em>.&#160; I was managing.</p>\n<p>I turned my attention to Scion.&#160; Apparently Tattletale had been right.&#160; A bit of a fib on Cauldron&#8217;s part, that they couldn&#8217;t use the clairvoyant on him.&#160; They&#8217;d wanted to avoid Scion finding them, avoid having him find his way to their laboratories.</p>\n<p>When I looked, I saw him screaming.</p>\n<p>Even for someone who had only ever spoken twice, it was an eerie, unsettling sound.&#160; Raw, like he was being actively tortured, a sound of pain and anger distilled, given volume by his power.</p>\n<p>He wasn&#8217;t being tortured, though.&#160; He was winning, tearing into the crowd with more ferocity than before, that same crowd where the others, people I cared about, were-</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pose?&#8221; Teacher asked, interrupting my thoughts.&#160; I&#8217;d missed the beginning of what he&#8217;d said.</p>\n<p>I raised my head.&#160; It was more like I saw the movement of my head through a telescope than it was like owning the head itself.</p>\n<p>Right.&#160; I&#8217;d zoned out again.&#160; Taking in too much.</p>\n<p>Needed to move.</p>\n<p>I was omniscient.&#160; More accurately, I was as close to omniscient as I could hope to get.&#160; It came with an Achilles heel, but I&#8217;d make do.</p>\n<p>My phone had the last known location of the C.U.I. portal.&#160; I opened a door to it.</p>\n<p>I left Teacher behind.&#160; He didn&#8217;t warrant a goodbye.&#160; If there <em>was</em> such a thing as Karma, he&#8217;d get it soon enough.&#160; For now, I would put off getting revenge for what he&#8217;d done to Dragon.&#160; He&#8217;d be inconvenienced by the loss of his soldiers and disruption of his base of operations, but he&#8217;d recover.</p>\n<p>Twenty parahumans flanked me as I walked down the dirt road.&#160; I stopped when we&#8217;d come to the portal&#8217;s location.&#160; The C.U.I. had invaded, killing the refugees on the other side, then moved in.</p>\n<p>The clairvoyant, moving at my bidding, took hold of the device I&#8217;d fastened onto my belt.</p>\n<p>He hit the white button.</p>\n<p>Teacher had sealed himself off in one world, to build up his students and work with Dragon.&#160; He&#8217;d given that technology to the C.U.I., and they&#8217;d used it to secure their position.</p>\n<p>Now I was breaking in.</p>\n<p>The blind spot fractured, then dissolved.&#160; I could see the C.U.I.&#8217;s empire.&#160; Three hundred million people, many still migrating to places where they could settle, physically walking to separate themselves from others, so Scion couldn&#8217;t kill too many at once.&#160; I could see where Scion had attacked at one point, and they were still performing disaster relief.</p>\n<p>There was a member of the C.U.I. who was officially known as Ziggurat, though she was really &#8216;T&#333;ng L&#237;ng T&#462;&#8217; to her allies and countrymen.&#160; She&#8217;d used her power to erect stone walls and start the construction of a palace for the Imperial family.&#160; Three walls stretched between three impressive towers, with the palace at the center of the <em>acres</em> of empty space within.</p>\n<p>I could see the Y&#224;ngb&#462;n in full force.&#160; Three groups of sixty to one hundred and thirty capes, arranged on broad, square platforms of stone that had been raised off of the ground, each facing outward, their backs to the palace. Every one of them was in a matching outfit, their masks white, purple, and yellow, in turn.&#160; They were tending to wounds, and the gaps in their number suggested they&#8217;d taken heavy losses.</p>\n<p>Inside the place itself was a kaleidoscope.&#160; Each room was mirrored several times over, the occupants moving in unison.&#160; The main chambers had <em>nine</em> iterations, each with a copy of the imperial family, each with a fourth squad of Y&#224;ngb&#462;n ringing the group in concentric circles rather than in rows and columns.&#160; This squad wore masks like the others, multifaceted gemstones large enough to cover their faces, but the gems were a jade green.&#160; The bodyguards, thirty in all.&#160; The scariest capes in their group.</p>\n<p>A young man, fourteen, sat on the throne.&#160; On either side, their chairs just low enough to the ground that their heads were beneath the young man&#8217;s, were family members.&#160; Too young to be his mother and father.&#160; A very young child, a girl, sat on a mat at their feet.&#160; His sister.&#160; I&#8217;d seen pictures of the new emperor and his sister when their older brother had been killed along with the Simurgh&#8217;s attack on flight BA178.</p>\n<p>They were joined by others.&#160; Sh&#233;n Y&#249; the strategist was a surprisingly young man, wearing a black robe that was as straight and narrow as he was.&#160; He was focused on a small tablet computer.&#160; Beside him was Ji&#462;, the imperial family&#8217;s tinker, and surely the individual who had set up the kaleidoscope effect, throwing off would-be assassins and intruders.&#160; T&#333;ng L&#237;ng T&#462; was there as well, a very thin Chinese woman with a black robe and heavily painted face.</p>\n<p>Just below the dais were three more Y&#224;ngb&#462;n members.&#160; Null, One and Two.&#160; The key components in their power structure, the ones who divided the powers, controlled the squads and gave them the strength to be effective, respectively.</p>\n<p>If I acted, I&#8217;d be targeted.&#160; We&#8217;d taken out one of their armies, an infiltration and raiding party with the Simurgh&#8217;s attack, but there were four groups remaining.&#160; One of the <em>other</em> raiding parties was less biased towards infiltration and more towards <em>movement</em>.&#160; They were the cavalry, the blitzers, the ones capable of flight and teleportation.&#160; In the wake of the raids, the first strikes our side had deployed against them had been viciously counterattacked.&#160; Quite possibly Sh&#233;n Y&#249;&#8217;s work.&#160; Any attempt to attack was met by equal and opposite counterattack, targeting the leaders of the offensive party.</p>\n<p>Even with nigh-omniscience, even with my portals, I wasn&#8217;t sure I wanted to gamble on this.&#160; Overconfidence at this juncture would be ruinous.</p>\n<p>Better to sunder their confidence, than let my own be too high.&#160; They weren&#8217;t anticipating an attack.</p>\n<p>But two hundred parahumans and a set of elite capes focused on defense and counterattacks was ominous.</p>\n<p>I tensed, all at once.&#160; A stray attack on Scion&#8217;s part flew through the air.&#160; I closed Doormaker&#8217;s portals in the area, and it wiped out a building, along with six people.</p>\n<p>I raised the portal again, connecting Gimel to the makeshift hospital.</p>\n<p>Tattletale muttered something under her breath.&#160; Panacea said something I couldn&#8217;t make out.</p>\n<p>Two of my favorite people in the world, almost wiped out without a chance to even know it was coming.</p>\n<p>I looked at each of these things I treasured, the things I valued.&#160; My leveled &#8216;house&#8217; in Brockton Bay, the graveyard, my ex-employees, my teammates&#8230; and I looked at Scion.</p>\n<p>There was no right answer.&#160; No perfect battle plan on this end.&#160; There was no <em>time</em>.</p>\n<p>I exhaled slowly, forcing myself to relax.</p>\n<p>Then I began opening portals across all of the different worlds I could reach.&#160; I began gathering bugs en masse.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d heard once there were ten <em>quintillion</em> bugs in my world.&#160; Eighteen zeroes.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t control that many.&#160; Or, to be precise, I couldn&#8217;t afford the time to collect that many.</p>\n<p><em>Fourteen</em> zeroes?&#160; If I had a dozen worlds, each with really good swamps and rainforests to tap into, my relay bugs to help extend my pitiful, three-hundred foot range?&#160; <em>That</em> was doable.</p>\n<p>Fuck it all.&#160; There was a time for strategy, and there was a time for the brute force approach.&#160; Hell, the brute force approach could be called a strategy unto itself.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d find out about Sh&#233;n Y&#249;&#8217;s power the hard way.&#160; He could see attacks coming.&#160; Did it work when the attack came from every direction?</p>\n<p>I divided the bugs into tenths.&#160; Then I opened nine portals into the Y&#224;ngb&#462;n&#8217;s world.</p>\n<p>The tenth I opened into Earth Bet, above the portal I&#8217;d reopened.</p>\n<p>They <em>did</em> react.&#160; Sh&#233;n Y&#249; <em>did</em> manage a nigh-instantaneous counterattack.&#160; A hundred capes deployed to my general area, teleporting in, and then flying around with speeds that would have put them on par with cars on a highway.</p>\n<p>I watched from a distant location as my hand clenched, squeezing the clairvoyant&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;d deployed a tenth of the bugs on my location.&#160; I was hidden within an impenetrable cloud of bugs.&#160; I raised Doormaker&#8217;s portals as shields around me.</p>\n<p>Some entered the cloud, and the response was swift and brutal.&#160; The bugs consumed them, and my minions with the tinker guns shot them.&#160; I moved to a different world, closing the door behind me, just to make their job a little harder.</p>\n<p>The other squadrons had their own means of defense.&#160; One had eighty or so people burning red hot, torching the bugs by heating up the air.</p>\n<p>I began using portals, and I captured the group.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;If you little fucks had any sense, you&#8217;d know that getting the upper hand on me, just for a moment?&#160; It&#8217;s something you should be <em>fucking terrified of.&#8221;</em></em></p>\n<p>Not my voice in my head.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Oh?&#160; The ineffectual little girl with the bug costume is awake.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Memories of confusion, a pain unlike any other.&#160; Of utter helplessness.</p>\n<p><em>What would my mom think to see me now?&#160; </em>A thought from a different moment than the others.<em><br>\n</em></p>\n<p>I used Doormaker&#8217;s portals to capture other groups, though they were more scattered.</p>\n<p>When I had the majority of them, I turned them against the palace.</p>\n<p>Ziggurat closed up every window and door.&#160; The ring of Y&#224;ngb&#462;n members was standing now, on alert.</p>\n<p>It hardly mattered.&#160; They&#8217;d amassed this much sheer power, they&#8217;d controlled the people through manipulation, and now they were seeing what happened when the people turned on them.</p>\n<p>I felt a kind of anger swelling in my breast, and I knew it wasn&#8217;t <em>mine</em>.</p>\n<p>But it was still a feeling I could ride.&#160; Something that could carry me forwards.</p>\n<p>Fuck them.&#160; Fuck them for not cooperating.&#160; Fuck it all, I shouldn&#8217;t have had to go this far.</p>\n<p>The attackers tore down one wall.&#160; I saw one of the six mirror images of the kaleidoscope interior fade away.&#160; The interior was heavily trapped, laced with poisons, rooms with only vacuum within and, ironically, poisonous bugs.&#160; Had someone tried teleporting in, chances were good they would have met a grisly end.</p>\n<p>I moved the attackers around the outside of the palace, rather than subject them to the traps.&#160; They attacked different walls.</p>\n<p>One wall was penetrated, and two more shares of the mirror image faded.</p>\n<p>There was another contingent of Y&#224;ngb&#462;n within one of the revealed partitions.&#160; Red masks, like the ones I&#8217;d seen in New Delhi.&#160; A small squad of throwaways.</p>\n<p>I controlled them too.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before the last mirror images fell.</p>\n<p>My portals ensnared the remaining Y&#224;ngb&#462;n in a few moments.&#160; The fighting stopped all at once.</p>\n<p>I added Zero, One and Two to my swarm.</p>\n<p><em>Alexandria, choking on bugs</em>.&#160; They <em>hated</em> me for my arrogance.&#160; For what I was.</p>\n<p>I exhaled slowly.&#160; They were a little more aware than the others.</p>\n<p>Two&#8217;s power enhanced other powers.&#160; Refracted throughout the Y&#224;ngb&#462;n, it was what allowed them to have sixty powers at one fifth of the strength instead of sixty at one sixtieth.</p>\n<p>Her power worked on my own.&#160; I felt my control clarify.</p>\n<p>In front of me, One extended a hand, then carefully closed it.&#160; I moved it experimentally, testing the range of motion.</p>\n<p>Not as perfect as if it were my own hand, back when I had full control over it, but <em>better</em>.</p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be sharing this one.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t afford to.</p>\n<p>Sh&#233;n Y&#249; spoke.&#160; It didn&#8217;t sound Chinese, with the wrong cadence.&#160; It was a question, by the sound of it, accusatory.</p>\n<p>Maybe there was a power that would have made sense of it.&#160; It didn&#8217;t matter.</p>\n<p>There were five layers of overlapping hexagons, now.</p>\n<p>I had my army.</p>\n<p>But it wouldn&#8217;t be enough.</p>\n<p><em>On to the Birdcage</em>, I thought.</p>\n<p>I opened portals for my swarm to pass through.</p>\n<p>I passed through, and I found myself in the midst of ruins.</p>\n<p>Ruins, like I&#8217;d been thinking about before I met Teacher.</p>\n<p>I used the clairvoyant&#8217;s power to search my surroundings.</p>\n<p>No.&#160; The structure was only partially intact, devastated by Scion&#8217;s fury, by shockwaves and literal waves.&#160; That it still stood was a testament to how solid it had once been.</p>\n<p><em>This isn&#8217;t the Birdcage</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Gardener</em>.&#160; My old jail.</p>\n<p>The disorientation rocked me.&#160; To get my bearings, I didn&#8217;t reach for more <em>geographical</em> reference points, but I reached for the little anchors I&#8217;d formed instead.&#160; I checked and double checked them until I could be sure I was stable.</p>\n<p>For the second time, I tried to make my way to the Birdcage.</p>\n<p>I stepped through the portal, moving myself to a peak above the Birdcage itself.&#160; Though I couldn&#8217;t really <em>feel</em> it, I was aware of how cool the air was, the fact that my body, so small on that vast mountain, was sweating pretty heavily.</p>\n<p>Being surrounded by thousands of billions of bugs had drained me more than I&#8217;d been aware.</p>\n<p>Another weakness, another point where I&#8217;d disconnected just a bit too much.</p>\n<p>Was my own body supposed to be an anchor?&#160; Was that something I should cling to, at the expense of other things?</p>\n<p>I made myself draw in a deep breath, until my chest hurt, and it still felt so paltry compared to the <em>hundreds</em> of people I controlled.&#160; The view, this majestic image of the landscape, of a sky that <em>still</em> harbored the clouds of dust and debris from Scion&#8217;s earlier attacks&#8230; it was but one piece of a scene viewed from a hundred different pairs of eyes.&#160; Virtually all of them had better vision than I did.&#160; I was adrift in an ocean of input, one body, harder to control than all of the others, so easy to forget about.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d done it without thinking, bringing them with me.&#160; They stood on ledges and jutting rocks all over the peak, surrounding me.&#160; More than anything else, I could feel their fear.&#160; With so many of them, it was indistinct.</p>\n<p>I forced my own head to move, felt the crick in my neck, where I hadn&#8217;t really moved my head in a long time.</p>\n<p>The ones who were still in the Birdcage were the ones the cell block leaders had felt apprehensive about.&#160; Not necessarily <em>stronger</em>, but less predictable, less reliable.&#160; More of a danger than a help, if given free reign.</p>\n<p>As far as I could tell, it was the last large group of experienced capes I could collect.</p>\n<p>I opened a portal within the Birdcage, to capture my first prisoner.</p>\n<p>Containment foam rained down from the ceiling, sealing him in place.</p>\n<p><em>Dragon</em>, I thought.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t make another move.&#160; I waited.&#160; I&#8217;d expected this.&#160; It was why I&#8217;d come here in person.&#160; I could use the clairvoyant&#8217;s power and see a hangar in one mountain valley opening up.</p>\n<p>It took only a minute.&#160; A small armored suit arrived, a fast-moving model rather than a heavy combat model, much like the one she&#8217;d used to counteract our first attack on the Brockton Bay PRT headquarters.</p>\n<p>It perched on a rock in front of me.</p>\n<p>Dragon&#8217;s weapons were primed and ready to fire, the threat implict.&#160; When she spoke, her voice as clear as a bell in the clear mountain air.</p>\n<p>It was the same language Sh&#233;n Y&#249; had spoken to me.&#160; The same incomprehensible language Teacher had lapsed into.</p>\n<p><em>English.</em></p>\n<p>When I met Dragon&#8217;s eyes with my own, my <em>head</em> shook with the shock I felt.&#160; I might have collapsed, numb, if I hadn&#8217;t been holding on to the clairvoyant, with Doormaker gripping my belt.</p>\n<p>It was the anger that kept me going.&#160; I&#8217;d felt a glimmer of it when attacking the palace.&#160; I&#8217;d felt it when dealing with capes and civilians every <em>damn</em> step of the way.&#160; The only thing I wanted was for everyone to do what they were supposed to do.&#160; To be good and to be fair, feed the hungry, give shelter, to fix the things that were broken and to fucking band together against the <em>real</em> monsters.&#160; Save the world.&#160; For the world to make some damn <em>sense</em>.</p>\n<p>I found myself chuckling a little, and it was just as displaced and not-quite right as any of my individual movements.&#160; Off kilter, more like I was doing a bad job of acting than real laughter.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t stop it, even as I tried to pull myself together.&#160; I turned my face towards the sky, my eyes streaming.&#160; Her voice continued, insistent, the gentleness giving way to concern.</p>\n<p>Hardly the last injustice I&#8217;d have to face down in the coming hours, but it was a front runner for the biggest.&#160; The most decent damn person I&#8217;d ever met, and she wasn&#8217;t even human.&#160; She was the only person who was definitely still alive who&#8217;d helped me without an iota of selfishness.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t negotiate my way out of this.&#160; Even with the rapport we&#8217;d established, I couldn&#8217;t trust her to give me the benefit of a doubt.</p>\n<p>As much as I didn&#8217;t want to, I knew that the only way forward would be to destroy her.</p>\n'<h1 id="chap3">Speck 30.4</h1>b'<p>I didn&#8217;t break eye contact with Dragon.&#160; My eyes were damp, and it was impossible to find a balance in terms of keeping still.&#160; I either slumped over or I held myself so rigid that I trembled, an ache creeping over my body, my muscles too taut.</p>\n<p>Back when Emma and I had been friends, way back in middle school, we&#8217;d done one of the sleepover dares.&#160; Going into a dimly lit room and staring out our reflections.&#160; Repeat the name of the monstrous woman, a name that escaped me now, over and over, without breaking eye contact.</p>\n<p>The freaky thing had been that it had worked.&#160; My expression had torn, twisted and distorted, dark patches creeping over my cheeks and forehead, my mouth disappearing with only a blank stretch of skin in its place.&#160; I&#8217;d fled the room.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d later read up on it, because understanding something meant being able to handle it, and my problems back then had been ones I could understand.&#160; The effect was a result of the mind&#8217;s idleness.&#160; We only really saw a little bit of what we looked at, and our brain worked constantly to fill in the gaps and unimportant spaces with its best guesses.&#160; In a dimly lit room, with the mind focused on the steady, hypnotic repetition, the brain would fill in spaces with the only reference points available to it, taking from features in its field of view to patch together the face.&#160; Fear, imagination and the recently-told scary story of having one&#8217;s entrails ripped out through their mouth did the rest.</p>\n<p>The mind was an amazing thing, but it had limits and weaknesses.&#160; I&#8217;d been taking in too much even before I added the clairvoyant.</p>\n<p>Dragon spoke, her voice insistent, concerned, and pitched as a question at the end.</p>\n<p>I raised my arm and the stump of a limb to the sides, bringing the clairvoyant&#8217;s hand with me.&#160; An exaggerated shrug.&#160; I then let them flop down to my sides.</p>\n<p>Dragon said something else in response, a statement, quiet.</p>\n<p>Using the clairvoyant was an art, it seemed, and I hadn&#8217;t received any advice on how to handle it.&#160; I was figuring it out, though.&#160; My focus on Dragon was like staring into the mirror.&#160; There were too many details to clarify to keep my attention in one place for so long.&#160; Things were starting to bleed around the edges in areas I wasn&#8217;t focusing on, like a watercolor painting that was bleeding out beyond the lines.</p>\n<p>Subtle, but it was there.&#160; Was it the entity, trying to tap into my memories to hash things out where my perceptions were failing?&#160; It wasn&#8217;t anything substantial, not yet.&#160; I was focused on Dragon, above all else.&#160; The various people, the capes, the fighting, all were clear in my awareness.&#160; It was the hills, the mountains, the vast spaces of water or field without anyone nearby that were shifting subtly.&#160; Cities in particular seemed to be a jumble.&#160; Or was it just easier to see the differences and errors when a city was rearranged in a way that didn&#8217;t make sense?</p>\n<p>More to the point, was I simply losing my mind entirely?</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m running out of time.</em></p>\n<p>I raised my hand again, reaching out towards the Birdcage, below us, towards the comparative miles of space and containment foam, the forcefields and countless other effects that had been worked together to form the most secure facility they could manage.&#160; The empty space between the hanging structure itself and the walls that had been thickened by the engine was vast in a way that staggered me, just a little.&#160; Shit like that didn&#8217;t help with the fucked-up perception thing.</p>\n<p>My hand was shaking, the muscles in my forearm too tense, the hand too loose.</p>\n<p>Without breaking that eye contact, I gestured, turning my hand over, curling the fingers.&#160; I opened a portal at the same time, inside the Birdcage.</p>\n<p>Dragon shifted her stance, and that same room flooded with containment foam.</p>\n<p>She said something in that same, quiet voice.</p>\n<p>As communication went, it would have to do.&#160; Not the words I couldn&#8217;t understand, but the gestures.&#160; I&#8217;d declared what I wanted, she&#8217;d drawn the line.</p>\n<p>I wanted so badly to hug her, to cross the distance between us and throw my arm around her muzzle, or around one of her legs.&#160; To have something physical to hold on to that I wasn&#8217;t actively controlling.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t give her an opening to take me out of action.</p>\n<p>I began opening a portal beneath a flow of lava, a trickle on Earth Bet, at the mouth of a cave system.&#160; The lava met the edge of the portal, and it winked out of existence.&#160; A splash of it passed through the portal, touching Dragon where her &#8216;neck&#8217; met her body.</p>\n<p>She moved, jet-engine &#8216;wings&#8217; reorienting, pulsing with thrusters going on full to move her fifty feet to the right.&#160; Her claws met a cliff face, digging into stone, and the thrusters kept going, pushing her against the rock and holding her on the surface.</p>\n<p><em>Right.&#160; Okay.&#160; A different tack then.</em></p>\n<p>She was retaliating, too.&#160; Her guns trained on me, barrels glowing.</p>\n<p>I opened defensive portals before I even saw what she was firing at me.&#160; Lightning, crackling in visible arcs around what looked like sphere-shaped empty spaces.&#160; Controlled pockets of ionized atmosphere, probably, to give the lightning a path to travel.</p>\n<p>The lightning traveled through the portal and struck Scion from behind.&#160; I closed the portal before he could react.</p>\n<p>The guns changed, the barrels contracting, the mounts behind the barrels reconfiguring.&#160; A portal simultaneously opened behind me.</p>\n<p>She sprayed containment foam.&#160; Not a stream, but an honest spray, as if she was trying to paint the entire mountain peak.</p>\n<p>I stepped through a portal, putting myself halfway on the other side of the world.&#160; I stood on the roof of the Byzantine Tower in Istanbul.&#160; Third tallest building in the world, surrounded by a shattered city and waterways that were now polluted with detritus and rubble.</p>\n<p>Then I opened fire.&#160; Every parahuman I controlled with a ranged attack or gun fired into the portals I was opening beside them.&#160; The exit-points were beside Dragon, and a cascade of bullets, lasers, energy shots, ice, lightning, metal and other effects obliterated her ship, tearing through the cliff face.</p>\n<p>I moved my collection of people out of the way before the resulting rockslide could kill anyone.&#160; The thinkers and tinkers joined me, the rest relocated to other points on the mountain.</p>\n<p>The ship she&#8217;d sent my way was slag.&#160; Barely worth calling scrap metal.&#160; I checked it over twice.</p>\n<p>Dragon deployed her drones.&#160; Not ships, but tens of thousands of airborne craft, most no larger than a basketball, kept aloft by antigrav panels like the ones on my flight pack.&#160; I already knew that each was loaded with a specific payload.&#160; Containment foam, EMP pulses, explosives, tear gas and more.</p>\n<p>This wasn&#8217;t a typical fight.&#160; It was more like a war, two parties with vast resources at their disposal, with armies and incredible potential in terms of the tools we could bring to bear.&#160; In a typical fight, things would end when one person knocked the other out, but a war rarely ended that way.&#160; The fighting would continue until we&#8217;d done enough damage to the other that they had to give up.&#160; Dragon was decentralized, with no single point that could be attacked to remove her from the fight.&#160; Truth was, I&#8217;d probably have to destroy everything to destroy her.&#160; If she didn&#8217;t give up.</p>\n<p>If she <em>could</em> give up.</p>\n<p>As for me, I was inaccessible, out of reach.</p>\n<p>I was quietly confident I could win this, one way or another.&#160; She&#8217;d have to defeat every cape in my little army, every cape I potentially acquired in the meantime, and I doubted her willingness to do that.</p>\n<p><em>Don&#8217;t destroy my army.&#160; Please don&#8217;t be willing, don&#8217;t be capable.&#160; If that happens, then I&#8217;ve failed completely and totally, I&#8217;ve done this to myself and will go out as a villain, all for nothing.</em></p>\n<p>The fight against Scion was ongoing.&#160; I needed to be able to focus, especially with the way things seemed to be breaking down in the least important areas.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t split my attention between him and Dragon, or something that was nigh-impossible would become harder.</p>\n<p>The drones closed the distance, and my army began gunning them down.&#160; They were evasive, and I could take in the whole picture to see how Dragon was managing them.&#160; Not simultaneously, but close enough it barely mattered.</p>\n<p>I tapped into precogs and clairvoyants, along with other thinkers, gauging the best approach.</p>\n<p>Sh&#233;n Y&#249; informed me of the general thrust of Dragon&#8217;s attack.&#160; I could see it through his perceptions, mottled, indistinct lines in the battlefield.&#160; X drones moving to one of my groups, Y drones to another.&#160; The path they intended to travel&#8230; I could tell that as well.&#160; An initial wave of attacks to debilitate, and then the second wave, drones for a follow-up strike.&#160; The lines had a feeling to them.&#160; I could almost assign labels.&#160; Infantry, cavalry.</p>\n<p>I looked around me.&#160; If I drew parallels, tried to correlate what I was seeing with what Sh&#233;n Y&#249; was seeing&#8230;</p>\n<p>She was aiming to strike me.&#160; <em>How</em>?</p>\n<p>Seventeen Dragon-craft deployed from the hangar.&#160; Again, not combat models, but utility models, fast response and rescue.&#160; Craft she&#8217;d been holding in reserve, no doubt because the cost of deploying them outweighed their potential benefit against Scion.</p>\n<p>The clearer Dragon&#8217;s direction of attack became, the more Sh&#233;n Y&#249;&#8217;s awareness clarified on her weak points.&#160; Distant locations and objectives.&#160; Some were objectives I couldn&#8217;t identify, even with the clairvoyant.&#160; He only saw within the boundaries of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Others&#8230; valid targets.&#160; I sent one squad to an army base.&#160; Pulses of gravity and intense heat let me detonate the contents of a munitions depot and direct the force of the explosion in one direction.&#160; The end result annihilated a data center Dragon had set up nearby.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m sorry.</em></p>\n<p>I could see her reaction, in the broadest sense.&#160; Where her drones had been micromanaged before, they weren&#8217;t being controlled now.&#160; She was focusing elsewhere, controlling the larger craft and assigning them to the protection of the various data centers.</p>\n<p>There was a skeleton crew of people at one facility.&#160; A data management firm that Dragon had bought out, I suspected, because the entire databank was reading as hers.&#160; Row upon row of servers, standing like tombstones in refrigerated rooms.&#160; Freezing air poured through the floor, pushing up against the warmer air.&#160; The facility seemed more like an alien landscape of steel and cold than anything of human design, complete with a constant, persistent weather pattern &#8211; a constant, gale-force wind generated by the movements of hot and cold air in what had to have been a careful design.</p>\n<p>That the crew had stayed suggested something about their personalities.&#160; Discreet, paranoid people, who&#8217;d built a shelter inside the facility as a hiding place, in case things went to hell.</p>\n<p>Which was pretty damn reasonable, considering the sheer amount of nightmarish crap there was in the world.</p>\n<p>I used portals to take control of them.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t read what was on the screens, so I had them take a more direct route.&#160; They made their way through the building, throwing switches, pulling plugs and opening sealed doors.</p>\n<p>Three of my Y&#224;ngb&#462;n capes entered the facility through portals and began generating heat as they&#8217;d done outside the C.U.I.&#8217;s Imperial Palace.&#160; I could find the freezer&#8230; and another cape could step through to damage it.&#160; Dragon&#8217;s utility craft arrived on site, but the damage had been done.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m sorry</em>, I thought, again.&#160; My attention shifted to the monitors and gauges in her various databanks.&#160; I could see dials shift closer to red, numbers rising, gauges nearly filled.</p>\n<p>Dragon could manage her things, I told myself.&#160; She had safeguards, ways of keeping her data safe.&#160; There was no doubt in my mind on that score.&#160; Each time I disabled a facility, I forced her to consolidate, to put the resources that remained under further stress.</p>\n<p>My ranged capes aimed for portals once again.&#160; This time, I put the exit portals against Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, aiming for the general direction of a satellite.</p>\n<p>It took thirty seconds of sustained fire before Sh&#233;n Y&#249;&#8217;s power stopped telling me it was a weak point.&#160; Other thinker powers in my range were giving me similar feedback.&#160; A cape with perfect eyesight was telling me it could even see the explosion.</p>\n<p>The displays across Dragon&#8217;s private realm shifted further.</p>\n<p>She was saying something to Defiant, words I couldn&#8217;t make out.&#160; I could see him tensing, moving like he was going to go somewhere.&#160; Then Dragon spoke again, and he went still.&#160; His head turned in Scion&#8217;s general direction.</p>\n<p><em>Please stop</em>, I thought.&#160; <em>Don&#8217;t make me go further.</em></p>\n<p>She went further.&#160; She intensified and organized the attack, and her drones reached my front line, disabling them with nonviolent means.&#160; Tranquilizers, electric pulses, containment foam and tear gas.</p>\n<p>I let it happen, because I needed to see what her second wave attack was, before she organized a more efficient frontline attack.</p>\n<p>The second wave approached, and they made a beeline for the portals that were controlling my minions.&#160; The portals that would exit right next to me.&#160; But the drones were too large&#8230;</p>\n<p>Until they jettisoned outer shells and accelerated.&#160; Half the payload, but they had the same kind of propulsion jets I had in my flight pack.&#160; I moved the portals a fraction of a second before they speared through, and they continued onward through open air.</p>\n<p>Sh&#233;n Y&#249; informed me about the third wave&#8217;s imminent attack.&#160; Not a feeling of attack, but&#8230; the initial wave had read to his senses as something like infantry or spearmen.&#160; The second wave had read as cavalry.</p>\n<p>This?&#160; A siege weapon?&#160; The lines that Sh&#233;n Y&#249;&#8217;s power painted on the world indicated something deliberate, devastating, but diffuse, somehow indirect.</p>\n<p>I directed fire at the drones, and forcefields served to protect most.&#160; The non-Y&#224;ngb&#462;n capes I had that could penetrate the forcefields were few and far between, the drones too numerous.</p>\n<p>They set up, planting their mechanical limbs firmly on the ground, and then they deployed, pyramid-shaped structures, glowing blue at the peak.</p>\n<p>My portals began opening, ones I&#8217;d closed not long ago.&#160; Portals I&#8217;d opened to control my capes, and the larger portal I&#8217;d opened to escape to this location on the Byzantine Tower.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t shut them.</p>\n<p>Drones started to make their way through.</p>\n<p>I, in turn, opened another portal, handing one tinker device to Sh&#233;n Y&#249; before hurrying on, leading the rest through.&#160; Portals blocked the drone&#8217;s ranged fire.</p>\n<p>The Y&#224;ngb&#462;n&#8217;s strategist used Teacher&#8217;s device, and all the doors in his vicinity slammed shut.</p>\n<p>Dragon&#8217;s path to me was shut.</p>\n<p>I watched the meters and gauges.&#160; Each attack had pushed Dragon&#8217;s remaining resources closer to capacity.&#160; That was on top of the extra strain she was under with Scion having done so much damage to the Eastern seaboard.&#160; He would have eliminated other databanks when he&#8217;d attacked.&#160; Just like me, she&#8217;d been wounded and disabled before entering into our private war.&#160; Just like me, she desperately wanted to focus on Scion, but she couldn&#8217;t afford to.</p>\n<p>If each attack pushed the remaining databanks four percent closer to capacity, at a guess&#8230; no.&#160; I was having trouble putting the numbers together.&#160; Had to eyeball all of it.</p>\n<p>I targeted another facility.&#160; All of the ranged attacks, channeled through open portals, ripping through an unoccupied facility.</p>\n<p>In quiet horror, I watched meters flip over into the red, gauges hitting maximum capacity, bars filling, characters on screens going nutso until they were all the same digit, repeated ad infinitum.</p>\n<p>One by one, monitors went blank.&#160; Server banks I hadn&#8217;t even touched began to spin down, fans stopping, lights fading.&#160; Whole grids of blinking green lights winked out, some in order, others at random.</p>\n<p>I watched, silent and frozen, as the process continued.</p>\n<p><em>Stop,</em> I thought.&#160; <em>That&#8217;s enough.</em></p>\n<p>You have backup servers, I thought.&#160; Those servers need to stay online.&#160; They have to stay online, because you can&#8217;t exist in stasis any more than I could.</p>\n<p>She needed life support, at a bare minimum.&#160; She couldn&#8217;t go any length of time without something running any more than I could go for a duration without a heartbeat or breathing.</p>\n<p>But the lights continued to go out.</p>\n<p>She said things to others, over the comms systems.&#160; To Chevalier and other various heroes.&#160; A few words or a statement or two, specific to each of them.</p>\n<p>Some longer words and phrases dedicated to Defiant, and more acerbic words for Teacher and Saint.</p>\n<p>Saint didn&#8217;t react, but Teacher raised his phone, tapping it a few times before saluting the air with the device.</p>\n<p>The drones close enough to do so sank to the ground all across the mountain&#8217;s peak.&#160; Her suits had already retreated and settled on the ground.&#160; Defiant was very still as he watched them land.</p>\n<p>Then Scion attacked, screaming incoherently, and Defiant moved, taking control of one ship.</p>\n<p>The last of Dragon&#8217;s lights went out.</p>\n<p>I stood in a daze as the various machines went still, surprisingly hot as the fans stopped spinning.&#160; All of the server rooms and data banks were utterly dark and quiet.</p>\n<p>Drones that hadn&#8217;t been close enough to the surface to land dropped out of the air.&#160; They hit the ground, along with one or two members of my swarm, and I flinched with the crashing, as if they were striking me.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m sorry</em>, I thought, but it wasn&#8217;t my thought.&#160; A memory.</p>\n<p>It was good that my power was saying it, because I couldn&#8217;t.&#160; My own thoughts were a jumble.</p>\n<p>My feelings were a chaotic mess.&#160; A lump was growing in my throat, swelling beyond my ability to tolerate it.</p>\n<p>I hunched over, and I very nearly let go of the clairvoyant&#8217;s hand before remembering that I couldn&#8217;t.&#160; Instead, Doormaker and the clairvoyant both pulled at my mask until it was halfway up my face.&#160; I felt the lump become a wave of vomit, spattering over the rooftop.&#160; It hurt, not just the physical act, and yet it felt like so little.&#160; Still a scene I was experiencing while half-numb, experiencing from a distance.</p>\n<p><em>I miscalculated?</em></p>\n<p>Had she been vulnerable because of what Teacher had done to her?</p>\n<p>Something else?</p>\n<p>Did it even matter?</p>\n<p>I felt the need to throw up again, almost wanted to, just for that relief from what was welling up inside.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;d been an ally, a friend.</p>\n<p>I wanted to scream, to yell at her for being like all of the others and refusing to play along, to listen and cooperate.&#160; I wanted to do the opposite, to beg her forgiveness, and hate <em>myself</em> for being exactly what I&#8217;d criticized others for.</p>\n<p>I wanted to put all of those feelings aside and start dealing with Scion.&#160; I wanted to give up on that entirely, because, fuck it, what was I even trying to save, at this point?</p>\n<p>If I&#8217;d been whole, if I&#8217;d been balanced, I might have been able to find the middle road between the conflicting ideas.&#160; But I wasn&#8217;t.&#160; I remained hunched over, almost paralyzed.</p>\n<p>My anchors&#8230; what had I chosen, again?&#160; Tattletale, Rachel, Imp&#8230; Grue&#8217;s cabin.&#160; My interlinking hexagonal portals were a mess.&#160; In the course of fighting Dragon, I&#8217;d closed portals and opened others without any attention to keeping it together. That was something to pay attention to.&#160; If I wasn&#8217;t feeling my emotions as clearly as I should, I had to look for the external clues, and that jumble was suggestive of an emotional turmoil I&#8217;d been suppressing.</p>\n<p>I began pulling the grid back together, not feeling any better.</p>\n<p><em>What else?</em></p>\n<p>I reached out, trying to remind myself of the anchors I&#8217;d set up.</p>\n<p>My mom&#8230; I found the graveyard.</p>\n<p>My old house&#8230;</p>\n<p>Where had it been again?</p>\n<p>The streets were such a mess, one pile of rubble virtually indistinguishable from the rest.&#160; What was I supposed to even do to identify it, if there were no landmarks?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d hoped to use the anchors to help push myself forward, but reaching for one thing that I&#8217;d known from the very beginning and failing in the process left me in a more unbalanced state.</p>\n<p><em>I was&#8230;</em></p>\n<p><em>I was what?</em></p>\n<p>There had been an idea I&#8217;d been reaching for, a word, a symbol, something.&#160; Yet I couldn&#8217;t clarify it in my head.</p>\n<p><em>Don&#8217;t panic</em>, I thought, but the words sounded panicked in my head.&#160; Rushed.&#160; Sloppy.&#160; My breathing was hard and fast, my heartbeat pacing out of control.&#160; Between the two, it was getting to my head, affecting my thoughts.</p>\n<p><em>Don&#8217;t panic</em>, I told myself.&#160; The repetition felt good, helping.</p>\n<p>Or had it been my passenger telling me not to panic?</p>\n<p><em>No.&#160; I had a perfectly normal lapse.&#160; Perfectly normal.&#160; A person in a stressful situation like this is going to have moments where she can&#8217;t come up with the right word.</em></p>\n<p><em>Perfectly normal.</em></p>\n<p>My breath wheezed a little as I panted.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t want to, but you have to, I told myself.&#160; Stop Scion.</p>\n<p>The portal slid open.</p>\n<p>Except I hadn&#8217;t ordered it.</p>\n<p><em>You want to take over, passenger?</em>&#160; I thought.&#160; I began to struggle to my feet.</p>\n<p>The drones moved.</p>\n<p>Defiant?</p>\n<p>Saint, taking over her systems again?</p>\n<p>They flowed through the doorway to Sh&#233;n Y&#249;, blitzing him in passing.</p>\n<p>No.&#160; Neither of the two seemed to be paying attention to me.&#160; They were focused on Scion.</p>\n<p>I began erecting portals, shooting the drones out of the air, defending myself against the initial bombardment of tear gas canisters and containment foam.&#160; If I was slow to react, it was because of the disorientation, the lack of knowledge of who and what I was up against.</p>\n<p>I had other thinkers available.&#160; Understanding their power was easier with the Y&#224;ngb&#462;n&#8217;s power boost.&#160; If they were puppets, the power boost meant the puppets fit my hand.&#160; I put them to work, trying to divine just who was seizing control of these drones.</p>\n<p>It was so much easier to operate when I was <em>doing</em> something.&#160; Time and again, my lapses, the <em>slippage</em>, it had been in the quiet moments, between the conversations and the fighting.</p>\n<p>It was easier if I was active, in the midst of conflict.</p>\n<p>This was me.&#160; I thrived when I had an opponent, and when I could carry out that goal I&#8217;d had from the beginning, getting the world to the point where it all made <em>sense</em>.&#160; Bringing people in line, subjugating those who would get in the way or do more harm than good.</p>\n<p>That was how I functioned.&#160; I&#8217;d always reveled in the chaos, in the madness of it all.</p>\n<p><em>No</em>, the thought crossed my mind.&#160; <em>Not always</em>.</p>\n<p>Once upon a time, I&#8217;d been Taylor, minus the powers.&#160; I&#8217;d avoided conflict.&#160; I&#8217;d just been trying to get by.</p>\n<p><em>Does that mean this is you, passenger?</em></p>\n<p>There was, of course, no reply.</p>\n<p>The drones kept coming, and I redoubled my efforts, calling individuals to me to form a battle line.</p>\n<p>The moment the line was in place, the drones shifted.&#160; Some entered the portal, then immediately made a &#8216;u&#8217; turn, flowing back around the sides of the portal and down.&#160; They circled around the building, trying to get at me from behind.&#160; I had to redistribute my personal army to block them off.</p>\n<p>The portals were open and I couldn&#8217;t close them.&#160; But the lights on the drones were off.&#160; No lenses glowed, the antigrav panels were the only thing that indicated any power at all.&#160; Remote control of some sort?</p>\n<p><em>The lights are off, but they&#8217;re still running</em>.</p>\n<p>I laughed, abrupt, an alien sound, not my own laugh.</p>\n<p><em>The goddamn lights are off!</em></p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t Saint mounting this attack against me.&#160; It wasn&#8217;t Teacher, or Defiant, or any of those other guys.</p>\n<p>I continued laughing.&#160; My winded panting and nausea from before translated to a kind of lightheadedness.</p>\n<p>Fucking <em>Dragon</em>.</p>\n<p>Fucking with my head.&#160; Giving me a reality check.&#160; Trying to catch me off guard.&#160; She&#8217;d figured out that I had the ability to see her systems, she&#8217;d switched off the lights on the panels, put every system into hibernation, stopped the fans, and cut everything down to a bare minimum while the fans had stopped, so they didn&#8217;t overheat too quickly.</p>\n<p>A drone that had crept around behind the building detonated in a flare of pale sparks, and every portal in the vicinity distorted, taking on weird shapes, more three-dimensional than two-dimensional.&#160; They winked out of existence.</p>\n<p>Leaving me in the midst of an army I no longer controlled.</p>\n<p><em>Fucking tinkers</em>, I thought.&#160; But I was strangely overjoyed.&#160; I was fucked over six ways from Sunday, but I was happy.&#160; I <em>hadn&#8217;t</em> murdered one of my favorite people.</p>\n<p>The capes at the edge of the rooftop were looking around in a daze.</p>\n<p>The drones were moving, assuming a perimeter.&#160; The capes at the edge of the rooftop looked lost and shell-shocked.</p>\n<p>And I was still laughing, clutching the clairvoyant&#8217;s hand as if it was one of the few things keeping me grounded.</p>\n<p>Capes at the edges retreated, bumping into one another.</p>\n<p>The laughter stopped as I abruptly let out a sound, half-roar, half-scream, incoherent, channeling every last iota of the lingering rage and despair into the noise.</p>\n<p>I commanded the people in my range to attack the drones, and I continued screaming even as my throat began to hurt and I felt like I might pass out from oxygen.</p>\n<p>Dragon was only just beginning to speak, some drones blaring out words in what might have been English, others in a sing-song dialect that was likely Chinese.&#160; The percussion and detonations that followed the attacks striking home drowned out most of it.</p>\n<p>The ones at the edge took cues, attacking the drones they&#8217;d just been fighting.</p>\n<p>Each and every one of them had been brainwashed.&#160; Some by Teacher, some by the Y&#224;ngb&#462;n. They hadn&#8217;t had freedom of choice for some time.&#160; Between the scream of rage, a pretty damn universal sound, and the action of the ones I <em>did</em> control, they defaulted to going with the crowd.</p>\n<p>I still had to deal with Dragon.&#160; Her intent was clear, from the way the drones were moving.&#160; She wanted to target <em>me</em>, and stop me from the source.&#160; I needed to do the same, and I needed to do it without destroying her infrastructure.&#160; I wasn&#8217;t going to risk making that faked death into a real one.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck you for fucking with my head at a time like this</em>, <em>Dragon.</em></p>\n<p>The thought wasn&#8217;t one of malice.&#160; My feelings were so confused I could barely tell on that front.&#160; I was <em>relieved</em>, disoriented, but those were more states of being than actual <em>feelings</em>.</p>\n<p>I was muddled.</p>\n<p>One task at a time.</p>\n<p>Stopping Dragon.</p>\n<p>I watched as the suits she&#8217;d settled on the ground kicked back into action.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;d fought Endbringers together.&#160; For a time, the Guild had been one of our biggest assets.&#160; I&#8217;d seen what happened when Dragon was taken out of action.&#160; A.I.?&#160; Nothing substantial.&#160; But when her <em>main</em> suit was taken out of action&#8230;</p>\n<p>I saw the way she deployed the suits.&#160; Which was she keeping safest?</p>\n<p>One was in the thick of things, creating different types of forcefield to try to mitigate the damage Scion was doing to our side.&#160; Capes had baited Scion out over the water, but the fact that there were less targets in range was counterbalanced by the fact that Scion was more focused on those who were there, and he was hitting harder.&#160; When he hit the water, waves crashed against the shore, doing nearly as much damage as any of his attacks might.&#160; A Leviathan with one arm, one leg, and most of its head missing was perched on the shoreline, apparently mitigating the damage.</p>\n<p>There were two more suits on the fray, offering long-range fire.</p>\n<p>And one more above the clouds, periodically firing exceedingly long ranged laser beams at Scion.</p>\n<p>The drones were making headway.&#160; These capes weren&#8217;t completely under my control and they weren&#8217;t the most stable, either.&#160; They were liable to crumble where other capes might stand firm.</p>\n<p>Doormaker was recovering his power.&#160; He could make portals, but it was slow.</p>\n<p>My first instinct was to regain control.&#160; I reconsidered.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t have time to feel guilty.&#160; I didn&#8217;t have time to <em>think</em>.&#160; There was only a moment where I felt the weight of what I was doing, the knowledge that if this didn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;d set everyone back for nothing.</p>\n<p>I opened portals behind Dragon&#8217;s longest-range ship, the entrance portals above my army&#8217;s heads.&#160; I began firing through the doors with every individual I could control, creating more portals to seize control of others with every passing second.</p>\n<p>More ranged attacks joined the barrage.&#160; Dragon flew out of the way, her ship badly damaged, and I moved the portal, maintaining the assault.</p>\n<p>The wreck of the ship plummeted from the sky, and the behavior of the other Dragon-craft changed, as though they&#8217;d switched gears.&#160; The drones dropped from the sky once again.</p>\n<p>Something told me this <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> a feint.</p>\n<p>I opened portals into the Birdcage, and Dragon didn&#8217;t stop me.&#160; No containment foam came down from the ceiling.</p>\n<p>Maybe fifty or sixty members of my swarm had been disabled by the nonlethal measures.&#160; With the Birdcage, I added seven hundred and forty-three individuals to my army.</p>\n<p>The nonlethal measures would wear off.&#160; It was a step forward.</p>\n<p>I turned to my passenger to sort them out, and I sent a share of them into the fight to reinforce the others.</p>\n<p>One obstacle, removed.&#160; Dragon would take time to reboot.&#160; I could disable her in a similar manner next time.</p>\n<p>Defeating Dragon this way hadn&#8217;t been ideal, not completely freeing myself of the distraction and threat she posed, but it beat murdering her.</p>\n<p>I turned my attention to the world as a whole, with the idea of recruiting other capes.&#160; I hit a dead end.&#160; The worlds were bleeding together, and it had gotten worse while my attention was elsewhere.&#160; I had to force myself to clarify what I was looking at, to tell myself that the areas didn&#8217;t make sense.</p>\n<p>It took excruciating minutes to get my head out of that sludge, and to make sense of what I was looking at.&#160; <em>Minutes</em>, as Scion tore into Alexandria, to convince myself that it <em>was</em> all in my head, and that Scion wasn&#8217;t actively tearing apart reality.</p>\n<p>I exhaled slowly, and the exhalation was a shudder.&#160; My throat hurt from the screaming.</p>\n<p>The going was slow at first, but it picked up as I let my passenger handle more of the load.&#160; Capes in hiding.&#160; Rogues.&#160; Deserters who had fled for safety in our hour of need.&#160; A surprising number of capes who had no costume, and who had barely used their powers at all, judging by the way it felt when I reached for their abilities.&#160; They were rogues who&#8217;d been subtle at best, or rogues who&#8217;d gone without powers altogether.</p>\n<p>There were the retirees, not <em>old</em> capes, but capes who&#8217;d been wounded, or who&#8217;d dropped out of the scene for other reasons.&#160; Their powers were more developed at their core, but rusty at best.</p>\n<p>I reached for the insane, along with those disabled by their powers.&#160; A small few, all things considered.&#160; Glory Girl was among them, in a newly built wing of a home for non-cape invalids.&#160; Something her family had set up, no doubt.</p>\n<p>I found members of Bonesaw&#8217;s Slaughterhouse Nine.&#160; Clones who&#8217;d fled, or who&#8217;d been left behind, lurking in dark corners, or simply hiding.&#160; A Mannequin, two Damsels that were keeping each other company, a Night Hag-Nyx hybrid, and a Crawler-Breed hybrid.</p>\n<p>When I had the vast majority of them, I began looking to other universes.</p>\n<p>There were capes in Earth Aleph, barely C-list by our standards.&#160; Sundancer, Genesis, and Ballistic were there as well, the former two in civilian clothes, retired, the latter in a lavish penthouse, fully done up in costume.&#160; My portals opened, and I had control of them.&#160; I left Oliver behind.</p>\n<p>Other earths only had a small handful.&#160; No doubt there had been contamination at some point where doorways had been opened.&#160; Whole worlds with only ten capes at most, half of which were case fifty-threes.</p>\n<p><em>Monster</em>.</p>\n<p>I shook my head a little, blinking.</p>\n<p>I found another Earth with a mixture of capes, all incredibly beautiful people, all in what was obviously a global position of power.&#160; Every flag that flew in their world was the same flag, and the gauntlet emblem on that flag matched the icon on a particular woman&#8217;s costume.&#160; A blue costume, with white fur at the collar, and a heavy cape that would have done Alexandria proud.</p>\n<p>I attempted to seize control of them as well, and the woman in blue resisted me.&#160; She spoke, and I lost my hold on everyone in her range.</p>\n<p>It was only twenty capes.&#160; Negligible.&#160; But I wasn&#8217;t going to settle.&#160; If I was going to compromise on any level, it was going to take more than this.</p>\n<p>I created a portal, and I ensnared Canary, who was busy rescuing the wounded, flying here and there with her Dragonslayer suit, her arms full.</p>\n<p>She set down the wounded, and then she passed through the portal.</p>\n<p>She began to sing.</p>\n<p>I was controlling her, and it was my song in a way, syllables rattled off at a fast tempo and severe clip, followed by long high notes.&#160; Not English, but not my own muddled speech either.&#160; I could feel her expressing her power through the song, through each intonation and sound.</p>\n<p>I brought her close enough to give her the benefit of the Y&#224;ngb&#462;n&#8217;s power enhancer.&#160; I had enough awareness of her power to know how to keep myself safe from it.</p>\n<p>I tried again with these foreign capes, in this world where this blue-costumed woman ruled the world, portals feeding Canary&#8217;s song into their council chambers.</p>\n<p>Those same portals let me attempt to reassert control.</p>\n<p>An attack from two directions.&#160; She wasn&#8217;t <em>immune</em>, only resistant.&#160; I felt myself assert control.&#160; I understood her power, even if I didn&#8217;t understand a thing about <em>her</em>.&#160; A personal, point-blank trump power, allowing her to tune abilities and defenses much like Scion did.&#160; A powerful long-ranged telekinesis, a compulsion power like Canary&#8217;s, presence-based rather than voice based, and a personal power battery that let her be <em>stronger</em>, for limited times.</p>\n<p>Where the hell had <em>she</em> come from?</p>\n<p>No powers that really made her <em>amazing</em> against Scion, but it was an asset.</p>\n<p>The others&#8230; they weren&#8217;t weak.&#160; Nothing gamebreaking, at a glance, but they weren&#8217;t weak.</p>\n<p><em>Sleeper.&#160;</em> I could see him, sitting on a lawn chair on a balcony, reading a book out loud to himself.</p>\n<p>More trouble than he was worth.&#160; I let him be.</p>\n<p>One by one, I brought the ones I&#8217;d collected to the battlefield.&#160; The prisoners, the brainwashed, the lunatics, the cowards, the monsters and the broken.&#160; They assembled in groups, in the spaces between the other major groups.&#160; In front, behind, above, and below.</p>\n<p>Canary&#8217;s song wove its way out of the portals.&#160; Slower than before, working with the wind and the waves rather than fighting against them.</p>\n<p>More doors opened, and more of the ones I&#8217;d collected continued to appear.</p>\n<p>Teacher was making his way into Cauldron&#8217;s base, walking past the heroes at the doorway like he belonged there.&#160; He was talking into his phone, mocked up to be like a PRT-issue phone, and the communication was going to every major member of the Protectorate and Guild.</p>\n<p>Contessa, for her part, was waking up.</p>\n<p>I was shaking, and it wasn&#8217;t just the tension.&#160; I wanted to sit down, but I knew that if I did, I probably wouldn&#8217;t stand again.</p>\n<p><em>My anchors&#8230;&#160; The mantle of portals, Tattletale, Rachel, Imp, Grue.</em></p>\n<p>My old house continued to elude me.&#160; That detail gave me a sinking feeling in my gut.&#160; I reached out for a replacement.&#160; Not my home, then.&#160; My dad&#8217;s workplace?&#160; No.&#160; Something else, something <em>family</em>.</p>\n<p><em>A quaint old house on a hill, surrounded by rose bushes, a grandmother&#8230;&#160; </em>Not <em>my</em> grandmother.&#160; I barely knew my Gram.&#160; I shook my head.&#160; The house on a hill had been a memory of something I&#8217;d <em>read</em>, once.</p>\n<p>It was unsettling, the seeming reality of it, the nostalgia.&#160; If I was a little further gone, could I have clung to it, used something <em>wrong</em> to keep my identity intact?</p>\n<p>I was still lost in thought when I became aware that I&#8217;d stepped onto the battlefield.&#160; I hadn&#8217;t plotted it.&#160; Had even felt like it would be a bad idea.&#160; Now Miss Militia was turning my way.&#160; Exalt was standing beside her.</p>\n<p>Teacher was talking, and they were responding.</p>\n<p>He was warning them about the <em>threat</em>.</p>\n<p>I could see people throughout the crowd.&#160; Protectorate members, team leaders of the Wards.&#160; They were tense.</p>\n<p>A voice carried over the wind.&#160; I recognized the <em>quality</em> of it, even if I didn&#8217;t recognize the words.&#160; Glaistig Uaine, welcoming me back.</p>\n<p>Crooning.&#160; She was pleased, on a level.&#160; I found her sitting on a mountaintop, surrounded by three of her ghost-capes.</p>\n<p>My small army had grown to be a formidable <em>force</em>.&#160; Three thousand strong in all.&#160; I had <em>thirty</em> layers of portals around me.</p>\n<p>Teacher said something, and it was Tattletale who replied.&#160; I could see her, and she didn&#8217;t look happy.</p>\n<p>So many voices, so many things to focus on.</p>\n<p>I felt momentarily lost in the midst of it.&#160; I had a large army, by parahuman standards, I was probably strong enough to kill everyone here-</p>\n<p>I stopped myself.</p>\n<p>Why had I thought that?&#160; I didn&#8217;t want to kill <em>anyone</em>.</p>\n<p>Glaistig Uaine continued to croon in my ear.&#160; Was it her?</p>\n<p>No.&#160; I was almost positive it wasn&#8217;t, and I had any number of thinkers at my disposal who could have warned me.</p>\n<p>I shook my head a little.</p>\n<p>I had a large army.&#160; I was powerful.&#160; I could move on to the next big step, but I wasn&#8217;t sure <em>how</em>.&#160; It was like playing chess, the moves I could make had enough gravity and nuance that I could only make one move at a time.&#160; What to do first?&#160; What wouldn&#8217;t open me up for retaliation?</p>\n<p>It was better if I wasn&#8217;t here.&#160; I turned to leave, backing through a portal.</p>\n<p>Tattletale, in that same moment, stepped outside.&#160; She gazed over at my army, then turned and looked straight at me.</p>\n<p>Her eyes were wide.&#160; She looked just a <em>little</em> freaked out.</p>\n<p><em>I don&#8217;t-&#160; I can&#8217;t&#8230;</em></p>\n<p>My thoughts stuttered.</p>\n<p><em>Tat-</em></p>\n<p>I clutched to every image and object I&#8217;d set in my mind&#8217;s eye, to the tethers that were supposed to keep me tied down.</p>\n<p><em>I</em><em>t&#8217;s too soo-</em></p>\n<p><em>Too soon.</em></p>\n<p>I was running out of time.</p>\n<p>Had to <em>move</em>.&#160; Had to act.&#160; It was easier, so long as I was in the thick of it.</p>\n<p>Glaistig Uaine was the real threat.&#160; She would be first.</p>\n<p>Thing was, I didn&#8217;t like the look of those ghosts of hers.&#160; A woman, one of the <em>really</em> crazy looking ones who had a costume that was more for revealing than it was for covering up.&#160; She was warped, twisted by Glaistig Uaine&#8217;s power until the costume and the body were one and the same, which only made her look more vulgar.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t recognize her, but she looked like one of the crazy ones.</p>\n<p>There was a guy, built like a football player in full padding, only it was all muscle.&#160; That muscle, in turn, was covered in armor that had spikes studding it at regular intervals.&#160; The helmet covered his eyes.&#160; He sat at Glaistig Uaine&#8217;s feet, and he was tall enough that her eyes barely looked over the top of his head.</p>\n<p>And there was a woman, so thin she was barely there, a look no doubt exaggerated by Glaistig Uaine&#8217;s powers.&#160; When Glaistig Uaine spoke to me, it was the thin woman who passed on the message, her lips moving.&#160; Like Screamer, then.</p>\n<p>I prepared to make a move, and I felt the danger sense of no less than twelve different capes in my army go off.</p>\n<p>Yet I still alerted the ghost in armor.&#160; He moved, lurching to his feet, and he spoke.</p>\n<p>Glaistig Uaine said something, and it was a single word, a <em>hard&#160;</em>word.</p>\n<p>He was a precog, and to look at him, he was a defensive cape.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;d been anticipating an attack.</p>\n<p>The thin woman moved, and a current of wind ripped through the air, two feet wide and ten feet tall, less a tornado and more a battering ram.&#160; It flew through the sky, homing in on me.</p>\n<p>I moved through a portal, and the column followed.&#160; It hit me like a truck, and I nearly lost my grip on the clairvoyant&#8217;s hand.</p>\n<p>I tumbled.&#160; In a sense, my lack of control over my own body helped more than anything.&#160; I was left panting, but I hadn&#8217;t tensed up because the reflex simply hadn&#8217;t been there.&#160; Being limp when I took the hit was better than going tense and tearing something.</p>\n<p>The Faerie Queen had anticipated an attack.&#160; She had to know what I&#8217;d been doing, how I was operating.&#160; If I used my power&#8230;</p>\n<p>What did the vulgar woman with the lipstick smirk and creepy white teeth do?</p>\n<p>Another column of wind homed in on me.</p>\n<p>My army threw barriers in the way.&#160; Force fields, walls of crystal and walls of fire.</p>\n<p>The column passed between them like it wasn&#8217;t even a consideration.&#160; I closed the portal in front of me before the column could zip through.</p>\n<p>I watched as it changed course, heading for the nearest member of my army.&#160; I might have been able to do something about it, but I suspected it would have found a way to me anyways.&#160; Instead, I shifted my grip, gripping the young man&#8217;s wrist, and making him grab mine.&#160; A surer grip than hand-on-hand.</p>\n<p>The wind-attack compressed, passing through the foot-wide portal behind them, and it hit me.&#160; Not as hard as the first, because it wasn&#8217;t as<em> large, </em>but it still hurt.</p>\n<p>The Faerie Queen spoke, her voice imperious, echoing in that curious way of hers.&#160; Indignant more than furious, but still with that bite of anger behind it.</p>\n<p>The others on the battlefield reacted, and it wasn&#8217;t to rally against <em>Glaistig Uaine</em>.</p>\n<p>Tattletale was murmuring under her breath.&#160; Was that-&#160; Was it my name?</p>\n<p>The faerie queen banished her wind-witch and brought out another spirit.&#160; I tried to capitalize on the distraction, getting one cape with one of the stronger ranged powers to attack her.&#160; A gravity pulse, a bullet that imploded things at the impact site.</p>\n<p>The man in armor moved, and the vulgar woman reacted, creating a circle of rippling air.&#160; The bullet struck the barrier, and the man who&#8217;d sent out the pulse promptly imploded, blood showering everyone nearby.</p>\n<p>Something indirect, then.&#160; I opened a portal a distance away, and I used Canary&#8217;s song.</p>\n<p>She kept the field up.&#160; I could feel the pain wrack Canary, hear her choke on her words.&#160; She doubled over and coughed up blood.</p>\n<p><em>A power counterer, a precog&#8230;&#160; </em>and Eidolon, now.</p>\n<p>If I&#8217;d used a portal, what would have happened to me?&#160; Would it have affected Doormaker or me?&#160; Or both of us?</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t feel very stable on my own two feet as I climbed to a standing position.&#160; I had a whole army, and I could lose them in an instant if I simply unloaded on her.</p>\n<p>I needed to hit her with something that broke the rules.&#160; Not Foil.&#160; I wasn&#8217;t willing to risk Foil.&#160; But <em>something</em>&#8230;</p>\n<p>I took control of Alexandria, instead, Pretender.&#160; <em>Controlling the person who was controlling the manipulative bitch Alexandria.</em>&#160; I took Legend, who was part of that fight, two foreign capes and Moord Nag.</p>\n<p>They were the ones running interference, buying us time to breathe.</p>\n<p>Now I positioned them.&#160; As I&#8217;d done with my bugs, I lined up the shot.</p>\n<p>He took the bait, shooting.&#160; I moved everyone out of the way.</p>\n<p>Glaistig Uaine&#8217;s pets informed her of the imminent danger, and the shield was raised in time.</p>\n<p>Smoke poured off of Scion, indicating he&#8217;d taken the reflective effect full force.</p>\n<p>And smoke cleared around the Faerie Queen as well.&#160; She was panting a little, her ghosts tattered but intact.&#160; I made her stand straighter, and then banished her ghosts, replacing them.&#160; I&#8217;d used the distraction to plant a portal behind her.</p>\n<p>I opened a portal, passing through, re-entering Earth Gimel.</p>\n<p>Miss Militia turned a sniper rifle on me.&#160; I caught her before she could fire.</p>\n<p>Then, group by group, I captured the rest of the defending force.&#160; Some resisted, some predicted the attack, but it was a foregone conclusion.&#160; I had enough soldiers, enough tools at my disposal, that nothing here really stood in my way.</p>\n<p>I created more portals, until I didn&#8217;t have space for all of them.&#160; I shrunk them, reorganized.&#160; Where I could find the open space, I tapped other worlds, reaching for bugs.</p>\n<p>Those bugs then swirled around my captives, flowing around their feet or behind them, where they wouldn&#8217;t obscure the view.</p>\n<p>I saw with compound vision.&#160; Five thousand pairs of eyes, collecting more with every second that passed.</p>\n<p>I breathed with five thousand mouths.</p>\n<p>I was adrift in a sea.</p>\n<p>My eyes fell on Tattletale.&#160; Panacea was behind her.</p>\n<p>She shook her head, putting herself between me and Panacea.</p>\n<p>I reached out, my hand trembling.</p>\n<p>It flopped down at my side.</p>\n<p><em>I need her as an anchor more than I need her power</em>.</p>\n<p>Anchors&#8230;</p>\n<p>My mom&#8217;s grave&#8230; it was in Brockton Bay, right?</p>\n<p>Brockton Bay.&#160; It took me a minute to find, more time because I was busy keeping capes out of Scion&#8217;s way.&#160; Putting them through doorways, bringing them back.&#160; Always being careful to keep the doorways from being touched by his power.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t find the grave.&#160; No time.</p>\n<p>What else?&#160; The mantle of power, of course.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p><em>Tattletale.</em></p>\n<p>And&#8230;</p>\n<p>I reached out, tried to find others, and I failed.</p>\n<p>It would- would have to do.</p>\n<p>This was it.&#160; Finally, everyone was working together.</p>\n'<h1 id="chap4">Speck 30.5</h1>b'<p><em>Now for the clin- the clincher.&#160; The ultimate strategy</em>.</p>\n<p>We ran.</p>\n<p>My number one priority was to keep moving, keep active.&#160; Things were easier so long as I was moving towards a goal.</p>\n<p>I had to get myself sorted.&#160; Wrap my head around the tools at my disposal.&#160; For that, I needed time.&#160; I needed to put distance between us and Scion.</p>\n<p><em>Stepping up the tempo, have to distract Scion.</em></p>\n<p>I reached out to Ash Beast, a living force of nature.&#160; It had originally triggered in Matruh, Egypt, and had been roaming since, making its way across Africa.&#160; All of the destructive power of any class S threat, tempered by the fact that it <em>usually</em> traveled on foot, and people could see it coming from miles away.&#160; When it reached a settlement, that settlement was usually evacuated.</p>\n<p>An unending explosion, a rolling mass of fire and smoke with a person at the center.&#160; Here and there, it took physical form.&#160; Whether it was the fire or a massive leonine claw that tore into the ground, it produced the debris, dust and ash that was its namesake, driven along the ground by the perpetual storm of fire.</p>\n<p>Creating a portal to give me access to it was troublesome.&#160; Others had tried to control it before, to steer it in the general direction of their enemies.&#160; Warlords, villains, masterminds.&#160; It rarely worked for long.&#160; When working with power on this scale, chaos had a way of trumping order.&#160; Too much energy disrupted the portals.</p>\n<p>I moved a forcefield cape to the Ash Beast&#8217;s location, and then created a bubble, putting it in range of the being.&#160; I made a portal within the bubble.&#160; More forcefields encased the bubble on my side for safety&#8217;s sake.&#160; My power operated through the forcefield, and the connection formed.</p>\n<p>I identified a young man, at the center of it all, and I could now think of the Ash Beast as a &#8216;he&#8217; instead of an &#8216;it&#8217;.&#160; He was surprisingly healthy, but he had a power that kept him in good physical condition, a natural breaker-class adaptation that came with his power.&#160; Energy to matter and matter to energy.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d use him first.&#160; If he died, the world wasn&#8217;t worse off for it.&#160; If he lived, well, I could discard him, leaving him in a foreign earth.</p>\n<p>Bringing him through a doorway was hard.&#160; He generated so much heat, and while his shape and form were malleable, they weren&#8217;t wholly under his control.</p>\n<p>In the end, I made a portal, and I used Trickster to bring the Ash Beast through, replacing a chunk of ruined earth.</p>\n<p><em>Shaping the fire, driving it out to the sides.</em></p>\n<p><em>Shaping the flesh.&#160; From energy to physical form.&#160; Wings.&#160;&#160; Catlike legs to spring into the air.</em></p>\n<p>The Ash Beast lunged into the air, above the water, and he streaked towards Scion like a comet.&#160; The forcefield cape followed, to maintain the connection.</p>\n<p>I moved Alexandria, Legend, Moord Nag and the others on the frontline through doorways as the Ash Beast struck the golden man.&#160; Golden light tore into flesh that had been forged of fire, and more flesh was created to replace it.&#160; The Ash Beast tore into Scion, and the flesh was replaced just as quickly.</p>\n<p>I created more doorways, moving people out of Gimel in an orderly fashion.&#160; Here and there, I changed the portals around, dictating different exit points to break up groups.</p>\n<p>Ranged attackers in one group.&#160; Brutes broken up into several sub-groups.&#160; Thinkers, tinkers, defensive capes&#8230; there were a lot to sort, a great many who had powers that needed a half-second to a few seconds to figure out, in terms of classification and application.&#160; With <em>scores</em> of these capes, it added up.</p>\n<p>Every cape had a place to be.&#160; There were capes who needed something to harvest, who needed materials, and I gave them access to their materials.&#160; There were capes who needed others nearby, and capes who were better if set apart.</p>\n<p>I assigned precogs, thinkers and danger senses to the various groups.</p>\n<p><em>Decentralize, </em>I thought.<em>&#160; </em>If Scion was the established force with superior weapons then I had to be the guerrilla army.&#160; Different groups moved to remote locations, different worlds.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t let him destroy too many of us in one good hit.</p>\n<p>Take stock.&#160; Who <em>didn&#8217;t</em> I have?&#160; I didn&#8217;t have Contessa, who I couldn&#8217;t see.&#160; I didn&#8217;t have the Blasphemies, who hadn&#8217;t even registered to me because they weren&#8217;t human, even if they had powers, I didn&#8217;t have Sleeper and&#8230;</p>\n<p>Why was it so hard to reach for certain names?</p>\n<p>The ones in the cabin&#8230;&#160; I&#8217;d decided to leave them be.&#160; I was having trouble remembering <em>why</em>, but I&#8217;d trust my older self on that score.</p>\n<p>They were dangerously close to Scion.&#160; If I moved them, maybe-</p>\n<p>No.&#160; I had to leave them alone.&#160; Rules, regulations.&#160; I&#8217;d set boundaries for myself once, I&#8217;d followed them, because I knew how easily I could <em>slip</em>.&#160; Those boundaries had been to protect <em>myself</em>, as selfless as they might have seemed.&#160; This was to protect <em>others.</em></p>\n<p>This was good, better.</p>\n<p>Capes who could grant flight&#8230; Glaistig Uaine had some.&#160; There was a girl in a red, black and white costume who could grant powers.</p>\n<p><em>Othala</em>.</p>\n<p>Right.&#160; Othala.&#160; She could give someone else flight.&#160; Send the right people to Scion&#8217;s vicinity.&#160; Trickster, some defensive capes.&#160; One of the capes who had served under the Blue Woman in that cape-ruled alternate Earth.&#160; He had a power not unlike Gavel&#8217;s.&#160; Glaistig Uaine offered some offensive power as well, but it was tricky and time consuming to dig for the capes I could use.&#160; She knew them <em>personally</em>, I had to find them.</p>\n<p>They appeared behind Scion.&#160; Glaistig Uaine distracted, with one ranged cape hitting Scion full-on in the face, another feeding fire into Ash Beast&#8217;s body.</p>\n<p>The Gavel-alike dropped out of a portal directly above the golden man, driving a narrow pole into Scion&#8217;s neck.&#160; Scion was slammed into the water, quite possibly to the bottom of the bay.</p>\n<p>The forcefield cape caught the boy out of the air before he could follow Scion beneath the water.</p>\n<p>I opened a portal, then moved the others aside.&#160; Reorganizing, positioning.</p>\n<p>Others&#8230; who was I leaving behind?</p>\n<p>There was a group still in the settlement.&#160; They hadn&#8217;t all moved through the portal.&#160; I reached for their names.&#160; Right.&#160; Tattletale.&#160; Rachel.&#160; Imp.&#160; Panacea.&#160; I&#8217;d taken the others, collected the wounded.&#160; The door was open, but they&#8217;d stayed behind, watching the horizon, exchanging words I didn&#8217;t understand.</p>\n<p>Who else?&#160; I&#8217;d left the civilians be. I <em>could </em>arm them, but I wasn&#8217;t sure it would be worth the effort.&#160; Bullets could only do so much, and the bigger weapons&#8230;</p>\n<p>Scion emerged from the water.&#160; I didn&#8217;t give him a chance to retaliate.&#160; Retaliation could mean putting the cabin in danger.&#160; I hit him, then backed the capes through the portal.</p>\n<p>He didn&#8217;t follow them through the portal, but he did sidestep through dimensions to reach them.&#160; I started to mount a defense, and he lashed out.&#160; I didn&#8217;t have time to react or give a command; I slammed the portals around the capes shut, and I opened another, larger portal, to take in the beam.</p>\n<p>The beam hit the surface of the portal, and only a fraction passed through to strike Scion from behind.&#160; Enough to kill someone, enough to kill <em>me</em>, if the beam had happened to touch any of my control portals, but even so, the portal itself took the brunt of the impact.</p>\n<p>Doormaker staggered beside me.</p>\n<p>The portal was wiped out.&#160; Without any barrier in the way, the beam radiated forward to wipe Ash Beast, the cape with the pole, Trickster, and Othala from existence.</p>\n<p>I was left with a decision to make, no time to make it.</p>\n<p>Was I going to be moral, or efficient?</p>\n<p>Two capes fell in my awareness.&#160; Acidbath was one.&#160; Another was a talented shapeshifter who was in bad shape beneath their moldable skin.</p>\n<p><em>Shapeshifter</em>, I made the call.</p>\n<p>One expendable asset.&#160; At my bidding, he strode forward through the portal.&#160; The clairvoyant retrieved a tinker device and dropped it through a portal.&#160; The shapeshifter caught it.</p>\n<p>Scion pressed the attack, while Glaistig Uaine and her assigned bodyguard managed a fighting retreat to a portal I&#8217;d raised behind them.&#160; Had to keep Scion in place, buy time.</p>\n<p>I had only a seconds to act, or I&#8217;d lose the Faerie Queen.&#160; I&#8217;d lost good capes already, so very easily.&#160; Now I stood to lose more.</p>\n<p><em>Have to-&#160; have to make it worth it.</em></p>\n<p>Thinking in <em>words</em> was getting harder.&#160; Easier to default to thinking in terms of <em>ideas</em>.&#160; I wasn&#8217;t going to throw away lives for <em>nothing</em>.&#160; I wouldn&#8217;t ask others to make sacrifices I wouldn&#8217;t make, if the roles were reversed.</p>\n<p>Maybe they&#8217;d disagree.&#160; Maybe they&#8217;d tell me they didn&#8217;t want to make that choice.&#160; But that was our instinctual <em>self-preservation</em> at work.&#160; With things at this scale, that kind of thinking was counterintuitive.</p>\n<p>Maybe they&#8217;d <em>agree</em>, if I had the time to explain.&#160; To sit down with them in their living rooms and discuss the ins and outs of things over tea.</p>\n<p>But I didn&#8217;t have the time to ask politely, and too many had already died.&#160; Capes and civilians both.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d leave the civilians alone, but it was fitting if I drew on <em>their</em> strength as well.</p>\n<p>Doormaker was capable of opening the doorways at the speed of thought.&#160; I had multitasking abilities.&#160; I could open them faster.&#160; Not one after the other, a thirtieth of a second passing between each, but <em>simultaneous</em>.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t target people this time.&#160; Portals opened across the sky in that foreign Earth that Scion and the Faerie Queen fought in.&#160; As many portals as I could fit in that Earth&#8217;s sky.</p>\n<p>Glaistig Uaine ducked back into the portal, and the shapeshifter I&#8217;d left on the ground hit the button.</p>\n<p>The portals around Scion slammed shut, and he disappeared from my mind&#8217;s eye.</p>\n<p>It left the shapeshifter locked in the same world as Scion.</p>\n<p>An obstacle, a speed bump at best.&#160; I was sacrificing lives for that purpose, putting capes in harms way, and leaving that one cape in an isolated world with Scion nearby.&#160; I&#8217;d decided to spend a life that lacked <em>strength</em> over the life of a monster.</p>\n<p>But that last gesture had bought me time to move the Faerie Queen of the Birdcage to safety.</p>\n<p>It had also stopped Scion in his tracks for a few seconds.&#160; If he was focusing on getting out of that universe, on altering his power to decrypt the portals and free himself to move, then he wouldn&#8217;t be paying too much attention to the portals I&#8217;d opened above him.</p>\n<p>There were perhaps two hundred Earths in easy reach that had military technology worth talking about.</p>\n<p>Two hundred earths with <em>bombs</em>.&#160; Every bomb that hadn&#8217;t been in some secure housing, every bomb that was small enough to drop through the doorway, to plummet to the ground below Scion.</p>\n<p>Some would be duds, no doubt, missing an integral component that would be put in place before a bombing run.&#160; But a handful, I suspected, were bound to be nuclear bombs.</p>\n<p>He hadn&#8217;t stepped through into any world I could see.&#160; The bombs had struck home.</p>\n<p>My body was shaking.&#160; I wanted to sit down, but I couldn&#8217;t afford to.</p>\n<p>I was hungry, I realized.&#160; Worn out.</p>\n<p>But I had to capitalize on our advantage here.&#160; Had to focus on sorting out my army, so this wasn&#8217;t for nothing.</p>\n<p>I broke up the Y&#224;ngb&#462;n.&#160; Null/Zero could share powers and he could take them away.&#160; But managing multiple groups was cutting into every group&#8217;s effectiveness.&#160; Against Scion, I needed more effective powers than a blending of less effective ones.&#160; I set Zero aside, assigning him a group.&#160; Autopilot for now, for a later eventuality.</p>\n<p>The tougher capes I had fell into two categories.&#160; There were ones who could take the fight to Scion, like Alexandria or the late Ash Beast, and there were ones who couldn&#8217;t, like Lung, Menja and Chevalier.</p>\n<p>There was a Vietnamese cape with a tinker ability who I hadn&#8217;t assigned to the tinker group.&#160; He was like Lab Rat, but simpler in application.&#160; Formulas to boost strength and size, turning regular people into hulking monsters.</p>\n<p>I put him to work, dosing capes who weren&#8217;t reliant on armor or anything of the sort.&#160; I left Chevalier alone, and left the Crawler-Breed hybrid be, but I dosed Lung and Menja.</p>\n<p>I put Legend and the Number Man with the ranged capes.</p>\n<p>Scion emerged, but he didn&#8217;t emerge into a world any of my forces occupied.</p>\n<p><em>He- he lost the scent trail</em>, I thought.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t take him long to find it again.&#160; He went straight through into the world where I&#8217;d stationed Glaistig Uaine.</p>\n<p>I opened portals.&#160; Every single ranged cape and every single cape with a gun that was at my disposal opened fire into the portals.&#160; The Number Man&#8217;s power coordinated their fire.</p>\n<p>I sensed danger from my precogs.&#160; I parted the group.</p>\n<p>Scion moved, and he fired a beam, striking down the center of the part.</p>\n<p>Not one of the attacks had hit him.&#160; Though I&#8217;d been moving them to safety, the beam had taken out nearly thirty capes.</p>\n<p>I counted Lady Photon among the dead, along with Revel.</p>\n<p>As if Taylor Hebert were one of my puppets, distant, fractured and broken, I could sense the sick feeling in her gut.&#160; Revel had been someone she&#8217;d- someone <em>I </em>cared about<em>.&#160; </em>Lady Photon had been a familiar face.</p>\n<p><em>Let&#8217;s go get that-&#160; Let&#8217;s go get him</em>.</p>\n<p>My voice, but not my own <em>thoughts</em>.</p>\n<p>The Number Man had told me the attacks would hit.&#160; That they hadn&#8217;t meant it was Scion&#8217;s precognitive ability at work.&#160; The ability to win, to take the upper hand.</p>\n<p>But there was a reason he couldn&#8217;t use it constantly.&#160; It cost him something, drained his reserves.</p>\n<p>By all appearances, he&#8217;d parried my thrust and struck home&#8230; but I&#8217;d taken a piece out of him.</p>\n<p>The rationalizing felt thin at best.</p>\n<p><em>Have to do bett-er.</em></p>\n<p>Scion was screaming, still.&#160; A roar, a kind of fury.</p>\n<p>Tattletale had described him as human.&#160; That meant human weaknesses.&#160; Weaknesses he hadn&#8217;t learned to adapt to.&#160; When he got angry, it was the fury of someone who&#8217;d never learned to hold back.</p>\n<p>I put targets in front of him, and he took the bait.</p>\n<p>A front line of the hardiest capes, decoys and projections to draw him in.&#160; Then, while he was closer, I was free to move in the heavy hitters who <em>weren&#8217;t</em> upwardly mobile.</p>\n<p>Lung, hulking out even before his power kicked in.&#160; Menja, Chevalier.&#160; A dozen capes I didn&#8217;t know.</p>\n<p>Had to mix it up.&#160; Raw physical strength, then a cape who was strong because of a telekinetic bubble that surrounded them.&#160; More raw strength, then explosive power like Hoyden&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>Move them in, then move them away.&#160; Use their powers and other powers to give them the mobility.&#160; I had two capes that could <em>assign</em> danger sense to protect things, alerting them when the subject was in danger, though the two powers were rather different in practice.&#160; It was a way around the fact that I couldn&#8217;t predict Scion himself, and I made the most of it, switching their targets of choice second by second.</p>\n<p>I could feel the fear of the people I was sending into the fray.&#160; Hoyden&#8217;s fear was like the scared-little-girl fear I&#8217;d experienced while concussed, wracked with pain and helpless at Bakuda&#8217;s feet.</p>\n<p>But she could hit Scion, and I needed people who could hit him.&#160; I needed every iota of strength I could squeeze out of these capes.</p>\n<p>I watched the world through Defiant&#8217;s eyes, and I saw the combat analysis program drawing wireframe models over the battlefield, trying to take in all of the details of the capes I was sending into the fight, predicting Scion&#8217;s most likely actions.</p>\n<p>I watched with the Number Man.</p>\n<p>I watched with precogs.</p>\n<p>Scion wasn&#8217;t inherently predictable, he wasn&#8217;t capable of being read, but I needed <em>some</em> cue that would let me guess what he&#8217;d do next.</p>\n<p>Telekinetics stood by portals.&#160; The Blue Woman and Parian were among them.&#160; When I saw opportunities, I used them to move capes further, faster, to get them out of the way.</p>\n<p>Scion&#8217;s rage was reaching a crescendo.&#160; The screaming was increasing in volume and intensity, the movements more aggressive, the attacks broader, less focused.&#160; A fist flew past Chevalier, followed by a blast that might have wiped out a neighborhood, if the capes had been in a city.&#160; He was grazing capes, failing to land a single heavy blow, and it was pissing him off.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t help that we were <em>hurting</em> him.&#160; He could adapt, but he couldn&#8217;t adapt when the same attack wasn&#8217;t used twice in a row.&#160; It put him on the defensive, keeping him on his toes, and every attempt he made to strike back failed to do more than clip people, injure and wound.</p>\n<p>I knew it was coming.&#160; Retaliation.&#160; Even before the precogs gave me any forewarning, I was moving to react.&#160; Portals opened wider, telekinesis pulling the attacking capes through if they couldn&#8217;t move fast enough.&#160; Forcefields and other measures flew up to surround Scion, mitigating the damage.</p>\n<p>He radiated light, and the light that escaped the barriers seared and melted the flesh of the offensive capes, as well as the telekinetics and defensive capes who happened to be standing in the wrong place.&#160; Translucent and transparent forcefields didn&#8217;t even slow the light down.</p>\n<p>I began shutting the doors.&#160; Alexandria and various projections flew in to take Scion on.&#160; Ursa Aurora, expendable duplicates&#8230; just needed a second.</p>\n<p>So much <em>pain</em>.&#160; I could tell how much damage that had been done even before I did any headcounts.&#160; People were suffering, and so long as they were under my control, they were helpless to express the fear and agony they felt.</p>\n<p>Instead, they were quietly stoic as their wounds wept fluids and burned with traces of the golden light.&#160; I put the few healers I had to work.</p>\n<p>They hadn&#8217;t even started when Scion used the <em>real</em> attack.&#160; I could see him move through Alexandria&#8217;s eyes.&#160; Through <em>Pretender&#8217;s </em>eyes, rather.&#160; Arms flew out to the sides, and then he <em>clapped</em>.</p>\n<p>I only managed to shut Alexandria&#8217;s portal a fraction of a second before his hands made contact.</p>\n<p>One strike of palm against palm, and the shockwave swept past us as if in slow motion, moving past every portal in the area that was still open.&#160; It passed through flesh, and it <em>stilled</em>.</p>\n<p>It was the same effect he&#8217;d used to quiet Leviathan&#8217;s waves, the same effect that had frozen floodwaters in their tracks and the same ability that had given him so much presence.</p>\n<p>Objects in motion <em>stopped</em>.&#160; Portals winked out, warm things plummeted in temperature, cell and neural activity was interrupted.&#160; Blood stopped in people&#8217;s veins.</p>\n<p>Every cape that had been touched by this <em>stillness</em> dropped to the ground, lifeless.</p>\n<p>I could feel the horror that was experienced by the bystanders.&#160; I knew that, given the choice, most would be running.</p>\n<p>But there was no reaction.&#160; Each and every one of them was grim, resolute, taking care of their injuries, getting to people who could tend to them or helping others.</p>\n<p>Rank and file, a dozen capes with electricity powers entered the area with the capes who&#8217;d succumbed to the stillness.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;d stopped, and an object at rest remained at rest.&#160; I just- I needed to get them moving again.</p>\n<p>A jolt, the electricity controlled by the capes in question.</p>\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<p>I pulled Bonesaw away from the tinker group.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t devote the focus necessary to use her power in any detail.&#160; I <em>could</em> have left her on autopilot, but I wasn&#8217;t sure that was much better.</p>\n<p>I revoked my control over her, leaving in in the middle of the room with the capes Scion had <em>stopped</em>.</p>\n<p>Then I turned my attention back to Scion.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t <em>dwell</em>.&#160; Couldn&#8217;t let him turn the tables and put me on the defensive.</p>\n<p>He was tearing into Alexandria.&#160; Literally.&#160; But she doggedly held on, delivering one crushing blow for every pound of flesh Scion ripped from her midsection.&#160; He was roaring as he did it, teeth bared, face contorted.</p>\n<p>The nature of his attack, the stilling, it didn&#8217;t fit.&#160; Not in tune with the anger.</p>\n<p>It had been another use of his &#8216;automatic victory&#8217; power.&#160; Looking to the future, seeing how he could do the most damage, then following through.&#160; A feint, followed by the critical blow.</p>\n<p>The good news was that it meant I was getting the upper hand, forcing him to take a shortcut to get out of it.</p>\n<p>The <em>bad</em> news was that I was almost positive I couldn&#8217;t win if things continued in this vein.&#160; My precogs weren&#8217;t countering his precognition, and he was blocking all direct views of him, forcing me to emphasize <em>indirect</em> predictions where I focused on the damage he was doing and the people he was threatening to kill.</p>\n<p>With each exchange, he was doing too much damage to our side.&#160; If I had five times the capes, if we&#8217;d been working together like this from the beginning, then <em>maybe</em>.&#160; But not like this.</p>\n<p><em>Same strat- strat- same tactic as before, just to buy myself a little time to think.</em></p>\n<p>My telekinetics, injured or otherwise, worked their magic through the portals I opened, this time focusing on the munitions that <em>weren&#8217;t </em>easily accessible.&#160; I moved ICBMs through a spatial-warping &#8216;lens&#8217; that let it fit through a doorway, unloaded crates of grenades and TNT with telekinesis, and I watched it <em>rain</em>.</p>\n<p>The explosives were halfway to ground when I had Alexandria use another dimension switch to force the portals closed.</p>\n<p>I needed to consolidate my strength.&#160; I had capes gathering materials.&#160; Moord Nag was among them, one of the scariest warlords of Africa, now traveling between dimensions to scavenge from the dead, her pet shadow devouring mountains of flesh from mass graves and battlefields, swelling in size.</p>\n<p>Lung was shrinking, keying down after I&#8217;d pulled him away from Scion, but he still had the raw strength from the dose of distilled brawn I&#8217;d given him.</p>\n<p><em>Coordinate</em>, I thought.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t be moving capes with telekinesis.&#160; There had to be other assets.</p>\n<p><em>Sifara.&#160; </em>A chief<em> </em>member of the <em>Thanda</em>.&#160; I&#8217;d taken to thinking of him as &#8216;Orbit&#8217;.</p>\n<p>But Orbit wasn&#8217;t quite it.</p>\n<p>His power required him to have a strong reference for those he worked it on.&#160; Eyesight alone didn&#8217;t work so well, because eyesight was faulty.&#160; His <em>preference</em>, for a strong connection, was to touch individuals.&#160; Failing that, he worked by eyesight alone.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t need to go that far.&#160; I could see through a hundred pairs of eyes at this location alone.</p>\n<p>A cape formed a ball out of stone.&#160; Roughly the size of a tennis ball.</p>\n<p>One by one, <em>Sifara </em>connected the capes around us to the ball.</p>\n<p>Sifara&#8217;s power maintained spatial relationships.&#160; He moved the ball, and every cape he&#8217;d connected to the ball moved a corresponding amount.&#160; When he turned the ball, the connected capes rotated around the ball by equal degree.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;d used it against Khonsu in our first fight, anchoring ourselves to him so he couldn&#8217;t teleport away without bringing us with him.</p>\n<p>Now we were going to use it for the opposite intent.</p>\n<p>Labyrinth and Scrub, the same pair that had made the portal in Earth Gimel, made more portals.&#160; The dimension switches wouldn&#8217;t work forever, and I&#8217;d pretty much but there were options for future attacks.&#160; There were more explosives, but nothing <em>big</em>.</p>\n<p>I needed a focus, a weak point I could capitalize on.&#160; To those ends, I needed to buy time to work and I needed to bait him into getting angry.</p>\n<p>Between them, Labyrinth and Scrub began making paths to other worlds.&#160; I watched as they paged through the available options.</p>\n<p>Scion emerged from the other world, having broken down the barrier we&#8217;d set.&#160; Fragments of Alexandria&#8217;s body tumbled to the ground, more like a statue than flesh.&#160; He had to flex his hand and use his power to free it of the left side of her skull.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d suffered for a few of the big hits we&#8217;d delivered.&#160; His flesh remained pristine, golden, but there were folds and scraps here and there where his damaged flesh had been stripped away and remained in place around the creases of his body after the replacement flesh had come in.</p>\n<p>He came out swinging, obliterating two continents on two different worlds before he found <em>us</em>.</p>\n<p>One rotation of <em>Sifara&#8217;s</em> ball, a row of doorways, and the capes were pulled backwards through the portals, which closed promptly after them.</p>\n<p>The debris hadn&#8217;t even settled when I had <em>Sifara</em> move the ball again, erecting more portals to send my capes into the battlefield.&#160; Brute force, capes who could tie him down, capes who could take a hit or two.&#160; I kept Lung in the fight, holding him back for later, when he&#8217;d be exponentially stronger.</p>\n<p>As strategies went, it would hold for at least a little while.&#160; Scion&#8217;s patience seemed to be getting shorter and shorter, and I was on guard for the next retaliatory strike.</p>\n<p>My heart was pounding, my mouth dry.&#160; This was looking grim, each exchange hurting my side more than it hurt Scion.&#160; Was there an out?&#160; A chink in the armor?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d collected all of the tinkers in one place and I&#8217;d put them on autopilot, a vague, nebulous goal in mind.&#160; To get them working together, I&#8217;d used Zero of the Y&#224;ngb&#462;n to tie them together as a group, splitting their powers.</p>\n<p>A few hundred tinkers, each with a mix of tinker powers, all working on a singular project.</p>\n<p>I could sense it, using the Clairvoyant and Doormaker both, using Labyrinth and Scrub.&#160; The solid space between worlds.&#160; A space that Scion had altered somehow, blocking off.</p>\n<p>Facing off against that, I&#8217;d had them build something roughly the size of a house.&#160; There was a gun build into the construction, but it was snub nosed, stocky and unimpressive.</p>\n<p>I gave Defiant the honor of pulling the switch.</p>\n<p>The machine whirred to life.</p>\n<p>Through the Clairvoyant, through Labyrinth and Doormaker, I could sense the machine reaching through every available world.</p>\n<p>The energy was focused on a single space, but it filled that same space in each of the worlds.&#160; A pressure of sorts started to form.</p>\n<p>It would take a minute.</p>\n<p>I sent Moord Nag in with the other heavy hitters, relieving the force that Scion was fighting.</p>\n<p><em>Sifara</em> moved the ball, moving Moord Nag a distance forward.&#160; Her pet shadow <em>Scavenger</em> loomed, as large as it had ever been.</p>\n<p>And Moord Nag promptly had a stroke.&#160; I watched as Scavenger dissipated into smoke.</p>\n<p><em>Wha- what?&#160; Why?</em></p>\n<p>I reached out to Moord Nag, and I could feel the damage being done.&#160; I moved her back just as I&#8217;d moved her forward, shifting more capes onto the battlefield to deliver some ranged fire.</p>\n<p><em>Why?</em>&#160; I was stunned, and putting my thoughts together in regards to <em>this</em> was like trying to swim in molasses.</p>\n<p>Had to act, instead of thinking.&#160; <em>Investigate.</em></p>\n<p>I used my ability to read the physical states of the creatures I controlled, reading my swarm much as I&#8217;d check a spider&#8217;s level of hunger, its health, fertility or the amount of venom available.</p>\n<p>Almost across my entire swarm, people were threatening to lose their minds.&#160; Literally.</p>\n<p>It was stress, a factor I hadn&#8217;t taken into account.&#160; I controlled their bodies, but I didn&#8217;t control their minds.&#160; They were bystanders, watching this all unfold, and even though I regulated their heartbeats, kept their breathing level, the mental stress accumulated.</p>\n<p>There were exceptions in every category, but I could assess my gathered army with broad strokes of the brush.&#160; The thinkers were coping best, the tinkers nearly as well.&#160; The masters struggled the most, followed by the shakers and breakers.&#160; The rest fell in some middle ground.&#160; Moord Nag&#8230; my control over her had apparently tapped into some kind of trauma or phobia she had, so she&#8217;d been the first to reach some kind of fever pitch in terms of the buildup of stress-induced chemicals and reactions.</p>\n<p>I was killing my own minions.</p>\n<p>I moved quickly, scrambling to get measures in place before I lost any more.</p>\n<p>An open portal and a telekinetic let me move Moord Nag to the only available, capable healer I had available.</p>\n<p>I sent her to Panacea, still in the company of Tattletale and the Undersiders.&#160; Panacea bent down to help her.</p>\n<p>I brought Canary to me, and she began singing, a high, sweet song, almost like a lullaby, her voice carrying through the same portals that connected me to my underlings.</p>\n<p>I was halfway to my <em>next </em>step, managing the tinkers, when Panacea reacted, backing away from the dying woman, shaking her head.</p>\n<p><em>You still- you still don&#8217;t use your p-power on brains?&#160; </em>I thought.<em><br>\n</em></p>\n<p>She&#8217;d had a setback, creating <em>me</em>.&#160; Now the old fear was back in full, at the most inconvenient time.</p>\n<p>Tattletale was speaking.&#160; Her voice was gentle, soft.</p>\n<p>It was awfully nice to listen to.&#160; Reassuring, even if I didn&#8217;t understand the words.</p>\n<p>Then, breaking me from the spell, Scion moved his hands, readying for a clap, and I shifted everyone out of the way.</p>\n<p>Scion <em>flew</em> instead, flying into one world, just as easily as a plane might fly <em>left</em>,&#160;<em>forward</em> or <em>down</em>.</p>\n<p>I could track his movements with the clairvoyant.&#160; As multidimensional as it was, I could trace a trajectory.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d used his &#8216;automatic victory&#8217; power again, and he&#8217;d targeted me.</p>\n<p>If he&#8217;d used it to <em>find </em>me, there was no escape.&#160; If he&#8217;d used it to <em>find and kill me</em>, it was all over.</p>\n<p>Was he that complex?&#160; Did he think forward to that degree?</p>\n<p>I ran anyways, turning my attention to the tinker&#8217;s machine.</p>\n<p>The gibberish text on the screen had turned red.&#160; Failure.&#160; The combined strength of all of the tinkers who remained, Bonesaw excepted, and it had failed.&#160; There was no way to get to the space Scion had sealed off, no way to his &#8216;well&#8217;, where he drew all of his resources from.</p>\n<p>My heart sank.</p>\n<p><em>That was my best guess</em>, I thought.&#160; The mental stutter wasn&#8217;t there, but the stutter only tended to hit me when I thought about <em>nice</em> things, about peace and familiar people and all the rest of that stuff.</p>\n<p>The best means of attack was to go for the weak point.&#160; To cut the jugular, to stab the heart, to go for the eyes, damn it.&#160; Scion&#8217;s well was the closest thing to a weak point that I could imagine, but he&#8217;d secured it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d told myself I&#8217;d know the strategy when I saw it.&#160; Targeting the well hadn&#8217;t been that strategy, but it had been a piece of it.</p>\n<p>I moved capes away, stepping through the portal Labyrinth had made, then having her change the channel, masking our &#8216;scent&#8217;, so to speak.&#160; I moved Case fifty-threes into the area to mess with Scion&#8217;s ability to sense things.</p>\n<p>He still pursued.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t move fast enough, even as each limping step moved me to another universe.&#160; Something about the way the portals opened, even if I closed them, it was like I was breaking ground for him to travel.</p>\n<p><em>This- this is the trouble with being on top.</em></p>\n<p><em>You&#8217;re all alo- alone when it counts.</em></p>\n<p>I put capes in his way.&#160; He swatted them aside, flew out of the way, and closed the distance.</p>\n<p>I felt sick.&#160; The shaking was as bad as it had ever been, and there was a coldness inside of me that made me wonder if I was in shock.&#160; My thoughts were barely coherent.</p>\n<p>I had Glaistig Uaine, I had her Eidolon shadow-puppet.&#160; They worked as a pair to hit Scion with the heaviest attacks I could find at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>\n<p>For all it mattered, they might as well have been a kids on the schoolyard, sticking their legs out to trip someone.&#160; Scion found his momentum again.</p>\n<p>Panacea was healing Moord Nag.</p>\n<p>I reached for the warlord, bringing her to me.</p>\n<p>Scion struck her aside before Scavenger could swell to his full size.</p>\n<p><em>Too little, too late.</em></p>\n<p>If not brawn, then traps and tricks.&#160; If he wanted to charge right at me&#8230; I&#8217;d do what I did against Echidna.</p>\n<p>I stopped and turned around.</p>\n<p><em>Foil</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Cuff</em>.</p>\n<p>They stepped out of portals, one to my left, one to my right.</p>\n<p>Cuff to shape a sheet of metal into a giant razor blade, Foil to rig it with her power, setting it in Scion&#8217;s way.</p>\n<p>I gathered every precog I had, putting them within my sixteen foot radius. I <em>gestalted </em>them with Zero as they made their way through the doorways, forming a&#160;Y&#224;ngb&#462;n contingent of future-seers.</p>\n<p>I wound up with a young teenager right in front of me.&#160; Brown haired.</p>\n<p><em>Dinah</em>.&#160; I turned her head to see her face, and she saw me in turn.&#160; I could see myself in her eyes.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m sorry</em>.</p>\n<p><em>You&#8217;re different.</em></p>\n<p>I felt a chill.</p>\n<p><em>No time.&#160; </em>I opened a portal to send her away.&#160; She wasn&#8217;t any use, and&#8230; and I couldn&#8217;t even articulate why I couldn&#8217;t keep her here, when I&#8217;d keep the hunchbacked Case fifty-three from Boston and the crazed villain I&#8217;d spirited away from Monaco.</p>\n<p>I banished Foil as well, sending Cuff and Canary after her.&#160; They&#8217;d keep Tattletale and the others company.&#160; I disconnected them from my control network, giving them free will once again.</p>\n<p><em>S-s-sen- Sentiment</em>?&#160; I&#8217;d told myself I&#8217;d be logical.</p>\n<p>Was I succumbing to emotion and impulse, letting her go?&#160; Or was I sticking to my rules, my promise that I wouldn&#8217;t leverage her?&#160; Logical, emotional, something else altogether, it didn&#8217;t matter.&#160; I wasn&#8217;t exactly balanced.</p>\n<p>I felt very, <em>very</em> off balance, as a matter of fact.</p>\n<p>It was the same as before.&#160; The precogs weren&#8217;t strong in this circumstance, but if I could get one <em>glimmer</em>, put this thing in the right position, move it, do <em>something</em> to get in Scion&#8217;s way&#8230;</p>\n<p>He appeared, flying straight for me.&#160; The group would have to do without her song calming their emotions.&#160; Hopefully nobody else would stroke out.</p>\n<p>With the precog <em>gestalt, </em>I could somehow get a sense of how Scion was going to move.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t matter.&#160; His hand glowed as he struck the flat side of the razor, and it dissolved into a ruin of glowing fragments.</p>\n<p>I could see him in person for the first time since this fight had started.&#160; My own vision wasn&#8217;t as clear as some of the other eyes I&#8217;d used to look at him, and I had trouble keeping my eyes fixed on a single spot.</p>\n<p>My head turned, and I looked at the others.&#160; Tattletale, Imp, Rachel, Panacea, Foil, Canary, Cuff&#8230;</p>\n<p>I saw Imp&#8217;s lips move.&#160; She was saying something.&#160; It was probably very clever.&#160; Something funny and witty and totally out of place.</p>\n<p>Or maybe she was saying the same thing I&#8217;d said when I&#8217;d parted ways with the group as a whole.</p>\n<p>Rachel was silent, but she sort of dropped to her knees behind a giant, monsterfied Bastard, who was lying on his side.&#160; Her arms wrapped around his neck.</p>\n<p>And Tattletale-</p>\n<p>She put her hand to her mouth, then sort of made a sweeping gesture with her arm.</p>\n<p>It dawned on me that I had no idea what the gesture meant.</p>\n<p><em>Be-be-because you can&#8217;t le- let me have even that</em>, I thought.</p>\n<p>Scion stepped forward, hand still glowing, and he blocked off my view of the group.</p>\n<p>The plan had been simple.&#160; Thanks to Teacher&#8217;s underling, I&#8217;d been able to retain my memory of the trigger event.&#160; Scion had censored the most pertinent details, but he&#8217;d left one vital weak point in the midst of it.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d analyzed us as a species.&#160; He&#8217;d seen how we functioned, the strategies we could employ, and he&#8217;d set himself on a path.</p>\n<p>But that path, I was almost certain, was predicated on the idea that we couldn&#8217;t work together, that we couldn&#8217;t bring our full strength to bear.&#160; We were too chaotic a species.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d made one mistake I knew of, he had predicted a future where he would meet his partner and then pursued that future, only to meet the brain-dead version that was in Cauldron&#8217;s base.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d tried to help the same happen for the <em>other</em> future, running, using the dimension encryption, they were the best thing I could come up with in terms of putting Scion in a world where he saw himself as the only one standing.</p>\n<p>He closed the distance, and I couldn&#8217;t get my thoughts in order to convince myself to leave, to figure out what resources to tap to get myself away.&#160; Teleporters, but which one?</p>\n<p>Scion put a regular hand around my throat, and the question became irrelevant.&#160; It was surprising, just how small his hand was.&#160; Larger than average, but&#8230; he was still the size of a <em>person</em>, for all his presence.</p>\n<p>He hadn&#8217;t killed me outright.</p>\n<p><em>H-he wan- wants me to show fear</em>.</p>\n<p>His grip tightened, leaving me unable to breathe.&#160; I clutched the clairvoyant&#8217;s wrist.&#160; When that wasn&#8217;t enough, I used the meager thread I&#8217;d managed to gather together to bind our hands together.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t in the most lucid state to begin with.&#160; Reality began to dim around the edges as oxygen deprivation got to me..</p>\n<p><em>Slipping</em>.</p>\n<p>It hadn&#8217;t been enough, in the end.&#160; It had been a three point plan.&#160; Pushing us towards a point where we were all well and truly united against a cause, doing what I could to trick his future-sight into thinking he&#8217;d fulfilled his mission, and finally, targeting his weak point.</p>\n<p>The weak point hadn&#8217;t been available to target.</p>\n<p>I might have come up with better, but it had only crystallized after I&#8217;d lost the ability to communicate.&#160; I operated best when I could alter my strategy on the fly, but that ship ran aground when I was steadily losing my mind.</p>\n<p>Tattletale was saying something, Panacea responding, her hand on Bastard.</p>\n<p>Tattletale snapped something in response.</p>\n<p>As if in a dream, I could see Foil raise her arbalest.</p>\n<p>I moved bugs, forming a barrier between us.</p>\n<p>She hesitated, then lowered the arbalest.</p>\n<p>I relaxed.&#160; <em>It woul- wouldn&#8217;t work a- anyways. &#160;</em><em>N- no use having them die with me.</em></p>\n<p>But Scion had seen.&#160; I saw his expression change.&#160; Contempt, tight-lipped anger.&#160; It looked <em>wrong</em>, his face so unused to showing emotion, his emotion as intense and unfiltered as it was.</p>\n<p>He was aware of his surroundings in a way that wasn&#8217;t entirely human.&#160; Still gripping my throat, he turned, raising his glowing hand in their direction.</p>\n<p><em>No.</em></p>\n<p>I still had access to my network.</p>\n<p>But I couldn&#8217;t <em>think</em>.</p>\n<p><em>C-</em></p>\n<p><em>Clo-</em></p>\n<p><em>Close the portal.</em></p>\n<p>The doorway slammed shut.</p>\n<p>Scion took one step, bringing me with him as he advanced between worlds.&#160; The movement made darkness sweep over my consciousness.&#160; I very nearly lost my grip on the clairvoyant&#8217;s wrist.</p>\n<p>He now stood opposite the Undersiders.</p>\n<p>Foil started to raise her weapon, slowly.</p>\n<p>Scion blasted it to smithereens.&#160; Foil clutched one ruined hand, dropping to her knees.</p>\n<p><em>I have tools.&#160; I have&#8230; what tools?</em></p>\n<p>Tattletale spoke, her voice low and casual, almost flippant.&#160; She was talking to someone else, I was pretty sure.</p>\n<p>Panacea responded, again.&#160; A shake of the head.&#160; She had tears in her eyes.</p>\n<p>Moord Nag?&#160; No.&#160; I&#8217;d moved her to try and stop Scion.</p>\n<p>Dinah?</p>\n<p>Dinah watched from a corner, her arms around her knees in a position very similar to one of the first times I&#8217;d met her.</p>\n<p>He pointed at Rachel.&#160; His first target.</p>\n<p>In that instant, it stopped being about stopping him.&#160; I just needed to interrupt, to buy even two seconds.</p>\n<p>For the third time, I tapped into every ranged cape I was controlling, and I opened portals around us to give them windows to shoot through.</p>\n<p>Number Man to calculate, to aim the shot&#8230;&#160; They fired, every cape that could shoot <em>shot</em>.</p>\n<p>All with the objective of getting Scion to step out of the way, to do another sidestep with that future sight of his<em></em>.&#160; Even if it was followed by yet another devastating counterattack.&#160; I just wanted him to <em>miss</em>.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t work out that way.</p>\n<p>It struck home.&#160; Every shot I&#8217;d lined up with the Number Man hit Scion.&#160; Multiple directions, even some from above, they hit his flesh with enough force that I was thrown to one side.</p>\n<p>Priorities.&#160; Rachel-</p>\n<p>Untouched.</p>\n<p>The others were fine.</p>\n<p>The clairvoyant&#8230; our fingers were only barely touching.&#160; The thread I&#8217;d wound around our hands had snagged on my armor, caught on the skin of his thumb and nearly tore the skin off.</p>\n<p>It hurt like a motherfucker, but he wasn&#8217;t in a state to complain.&#160; Still in my control, still in contact with me.</p>\n<p>For my part, I was coughing violently.&#160; I was maybe at <em>more</em> risk of blacking out than I&#8217;d been with Scion&#8217;s hand around my throat.</p>\n<p>I fixed my grip on the clairvoyant, then picked us up.&#160; The ground was scarred where shots had grazed Scion and touched earth.&#160; It formed a loose circle, with two spaces where the shots hadn&#8217;t touched.&#160; One space for me, and another for the Undersiders.</p>\n<p>Why had <em>this</em> barrage worked when the others didn&#8217;t?</p>\n<p>Had to buy time, make space.&#160; I opened doorways, siccing capes on Scion, driving him out of the building.</p>\n<p>What was different?&#160; I hadn&#8217;t added anything to the group.</p>\n<p>I <em>had</em> taken something away.</p>\n<p>I looked at Foil.</p>\n<p>I took control of her, had her bend down to grip a rock.&#160; I channeled it with her power.</p>\n<p>A moment later, I brought Ballistic through.</p>\n<p>He used his power on the rock.</p>\n<p>I was already moving the group to safety when Scion evaded the incoming projectile.</p>\n<p>His future sight power wasn&#8217;t like Contessa&#8217;s.&#160; Narrower, lacking imagination, but he&#8217;d set up <em>contingencies</em>.&#160; If X happened, then the power would automatically kick in.</p>\n<p>Apparently the cost of being hit by Foil&#8217;s power was worse than whatever it cost him to use that power.</p>\n<p>Not a magic bullet, but it was a good fucking thing to know.&#160; Could I break it?&#160; Abuse it?</p>\n<p>We retreated to an empty city in Earth Bet.&#160; The group kept a safe distance from me as we half-ran, half-jogged through.&#160; A bubble of empty space surrounding me.&#160; My portals flickered open and shut around me as I moved, keeping everything essential in my range.</p>\n<p>He was beating the capes I was throwing at him, and I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what I could do if and when he killed the last of them.&#160; Bonesaw had finished reviving the people who&#8217;d been stopped<em>, </em>and was working on the wounded, but that wouldn&#8217;t give me much more in terms of a frontline.</p>\n<p>Conversely, if I pulled them back, I was leaving Scion free to do as he wished, and his <em>previous</em> patterns suggested he&#8217;d revert back to his last priority target.&#160; Me.</p>\n<p><em>Need- need- need- need-</em></p>\n<p>The thought stuttered over and over again, a refrain.&#160; It was like trying to move a leg, only to find it cuffed to the other.&#160; Except it was my brain.</p>\n<p><em>Need- need-</em></p>\n<p>I shook my head like I was a dog drying itself.&#160; <em>Think- think straight</em>.</p>\n<p>Tattletale asked Panacea something.&#160; Panacea made a side-to-side movement with her head.</p>\n<p>Imp made a wry comment.</p>\n<p>The sense of <em>distance</em> that I felt was enough to rock me.</p>\n<p>As before, it was in the quiet moments that I realized how much I&#8217;d lost during the action.&#160; I&#8217;d been slipping, my vision getting narrower.&#160; I should have been able to take it <em>all</em> in, but the worlds were blending in together.&#160; The clairvoyant was like a drug, and I was building up a tolerance of sorts.&#160; Colors bled together like watercolor, images started to merge, and I wasn&#8217;t able to focus on more than a handful of things at a time.&#160; The only crutch I had was that I could see what my swarm saw.</p>\n<p>But the Clairvoyant was only giving me the ability to <em>function</em>, at this rate.&#160; I could turn my attention anywhere, still set down portals in different worlds, but it was getting slower and slower.&#160; Barely a consolation.</p>\n<p>I was losing it.&#160; I was almost out of time.</p>\n<p>The <em>certainty</em> I felt in that was enough to kick me into action.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t even look to my teammates as I stepped away, opening a door to step onto the upper end of the beach.&#160; Water crashed around my feet.</p>\n<p>I organized the tinkers.&#160; Changing their job.&#160; A weapon, instead.</p>\n<p>I collected some of the capes that were harder to employ, and I began pairing them up.</p>\n<p>Halo.&#160; Sundancer.&#160; A handful of masters with projection powers.&#160; A cape with a giant mask.</p>\n<p>All powers that <em>made</em> stuff.</p>\n<p>A ring of razor-sharp gold that produced forcefields and lasers.&#160; A miniature sun.&#160; Soldiers of stone.&#160; A golden mask.&#160; I had each of them make the individual objects as big as they could get.</p>\n<p>I retrieved Chevalier, and I did the same with his cannonblade, raising it to its maximum capacity.</p>\n<p>Then I accessed Vista.&#160; And I made it all <em>bigger</em>.</p>\n<p>I pulled the capes out of the way as the various weapons entered the fray.&#160; The sun was as broad across as a skyscraper was tall, the halo was only twice its usual size, firing a substantially sized laser.&#160; Scion avoided both.</p>\n<p>Chevalier&#8217;s weapon should have been too heavy to lift, but he didn&#8217;t seem to care.</p>\n<p>He shot Scion, and Scion was consumed by the sun.</p>\n<p><em>Everything counts</em>, I thought.&#160; If we couldn&#8217;t get to Scion&#8217;s well, then we had to hurt him on <em>this</em> end.</p>\n<p>He wasn&#8217;t content to stay on the defensive.&#160; He turned his attention to the group that was projecting the effects, to Vista, Sundancer, Ballistic, the masters I couldn&#8217;t name.</p>\n<p>Which was the moment the Endbringers made their move.</p>\n<p>The Simurgh plunged from the clouds, hitting Scion.</p>\n<p>Leviathan, healed a touch, emerged from the water.</p>\n<p>Bohu rose from the earth, going from a human sized head and shoulders at eye level to a tower.</p>\n<p>Tohu, for her part, had Glaistig Uaine, Eidolon and<em>&#160;</em>Myrddin&#8217;s faces.</p>\n<p>The Endbringers, come to the rescue.&#160; I <em>wished</em> I could have felt relieved.&#160; It was a reprieve, a chance to get our footing.&#160; But there was an ominousness to it.</p>\n<p>Like I&#8217;d told Doctor Mother, I&#8217;d&#8230;</p>\n<p>I reached for the memory.</p>\n<p><em>It- it&#8217;s humans who win this.&#160; Not something abstract, not- not something we don&#8217;t understand.</em>&#160; <em>We win this with our own strength</em>.</p>\n<p>Even if I had to make us.</p>\n<p>I gathered my army, bringing them to the battlefield.&#160; I spread them along the length of the beach, keeping them connected to the little round stone that <em>Sifara</em> held.</p>\n<p>If Scion turned on us, he could pull us away to safety at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d lost people, I had more hanging back.&#160; The tinkers were still finishing the gun.&#160; But I had an army, and I wasn&#8217;t about to lose any more people if I could help it.</p>\n<p>I began to organize another barrage, aiming with the Number Man, using Doormaker&#8217;s portals-</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t fire.</p>\n<p>Instead, I watched as Scion&#8217;s partner came to life.&#160; There was only one growth at first, like a stem, a human-sized body, pure white.</p>\n<p>The rest bloomed forth beneath it.&#160; A garden of body parts, hands, stretches of flesh, a maze of parts, all interconnected, all flowing from the piece in the center.&#160; All of it <em>alive</em>, this time.&#160; The garden, as Golem had said.</p>\n<p>Hands turned to gesture, and flames rose from fingertips.</p>\n<p>A moment later, <em>ice</em>.&#160; Experimenting, testing powers.</p>\n<p>Then it <em>spoke</em>.&#160; A soft voice that somehow seemed familiar.</p>\n<p>Scion&#8217;s companion had been gray, this one was white.&#160; This wasn&#8217;t it.</p>\n<p>A <em>third</em> entity?</p>\n<p>I stared, my blood running cold.</p>\n<p>Scion tried to float down to it, fighting almost<em> tooth and nail</em> with the Endbringers to get to his new companion.&#160; Even in the midst of the fighting, the mood was entirely different.&#160; The rage had given way, gone.&#160; I could sense shock, bewilderment&#8230;</p>\n<p>He reached out, almost as if he were <em>afraid</em> to touch it.&#160; To touch <em>her</em>.</p>\n<p>Where had it come from?&#160; I used the clairvoyant, tracing it back to the origin point-</p>\n<p>I realized it at the same moment Scion did.&#160; Our emotions at our simultaneous realizations couldn&#8217;t have been more different.</p>\n<p>I had to wrack my brain, struggling to find the word in the muddle.</p>\n<p><em>B-bastard</em>.</p>\n<p>Scion howled.&#160; Not a scream of rage this time.&#160; Something else.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t an epithet.&#160; The third entity was <em>Bastard, the wolf cub</em>.&#160; Grown large by the bizarre interaction of Lab Rat&#8217;s formula and then cosmetically altered by Panacea, given a handful of special effects.&#160; No doubt coordinated by Tattletale.</p>\n<p>Scion&#8217;s mad sorrow was so thick on the air I could almost <em>taste </em>it.</p>\n<p>I used <em>Sifara</em> to pull everyone and everything in the area away before Scion could retaliate.&#160; Scattering them to different worlds with portals.&#160; I used case fifty-threes to break the so-called scent trail to Tattletale and the others.</p>\n<p>Scion shattered the shelf of land that New Brockton Bay stood on, and I watched in horror as the cracks moved radiated towards the cabin.</p>\n<p>I moved Ziggurat out of a portal, and I used her power.</p>\n<p><em>Sl- sl-</em></p>\n<p>I shook my head before I could get caught up in another mental loop of failed, stuttered words.</p>\n<p>A fissure opened up.&#160; The cracks stopped twenty feet short of the cabin.</p>\n<p>Scion didn&#8217;t hold back, entering another world, dealing just as much damage, then moving to the next.&#160; It became all I could do to keep my swarm out of his way.&#160; Even with Sifara, even with the doors.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t think straight, because I couldn&#8217;t really <em>think</em>.&#160; Not coherently.</p>\n<p>But I knew, on an instinctual level, that we&#8217;d homed in on the weak point.&#160; We just needed to drive it home.&#160; I reached out to seize everyone, opening full-size doorways so I could move them all to one place.</p>\n<p>It was when I was opening <em>my</em> door that the portals started winking out.</p>\n<p>It was like watching a blackout take hold over a city.&#160; Lights going out, sections of apartments at the same time, then buildings.&#160; Not all <em>even</em>, not quite logical in flow, but close.</p>\n<p>And with every other light that went out, I lost a member of my swarm.</p>\n<p>The portals shut en masse, ten by ten, a hundred by a hundred, the furthest one first.&#160; The ones next to me would disappear in seconds.</p>\n<p>I looked at Doormaker, who was staring into empty space.</p>\n<p>The realization dawned on me.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d spent it all.&#160; Too much, pushing it too far.&#160; The well Doormaker drew from in using his power had just run dry.</p>\n'<h1 id="chap5">Speck 30.6</h1>b'<p><em>I had a choice to make.&#160; Into the thick of things, or-r h-hang-hanging b-back?</em></p>\n<p>What I&#8217;d done, taking control, using people like sacrificial pawns, I&#8217;d made enemies.&#160; I&#8217;d offended the pride of countless villains, of heroes, even.&#160; I was a kill-on-sight target.</p>\n<p>I could sense the doorways closing.&#160; Only the ones close to me remained open.&#160; Though &#8216;close&#8217; was a hard label to apply when talking about dimensions.</p>\n<p>I turned to my old standby.&#160; I gathered my bugs, drawing them through the portals that remained, gathering them at my destination.</p>\n<p>I stepped through into the cloud.&#160; A rooftop overlooking New York, Earth Bet.&#160; <em>My</em> New York.</p>\n<p>It hadn&#8217;t been a conscious choice.&#160; An impulse, really.&#160; Maybe there were cities that were more fitting, but this was a city at the center of modern civilization.&#160; Or it had been.&#160; If this was going to be our final staging ground, then it was as fitting a choice as any.&#160; It was heavy with resources that every parahuman could use, unoccupied.&#160; Intact enough to still look like a <em>city</em>, damaged enough to remind us of what was at stake.</p>\n<p>With the clairvoyant, I could see the parahumans around us.&#160; They hadn&#8217;t scattered, and were still holding formation, more or less.</p>\n<p>For the time being, we were holding fast.&#160; Scion was still engaged with the Endbringers in Gimel.&#160; We had seconds, a minute or two if we were lucky, to catch our breath, to think, plan and communicate.</p>\n<p>If we were <em>really</em> unlucky, we&#8217;d have even longer.&#160; Long enough for people to talk themselves out of this.&#160; Long enough for trouble to find me, for the Birdcage capes I&#8217;d unleashed to cause trouble.&#160; The only reason things down there on the streets were quiet was because people were still reeling, trying to process, because they were in organized groups and breaking from that organization in times of stress was <em>hard</em>.</p>\n<p>Cults and religions and frat- fratern- <em>clubs, </em>they held together because of the power of the <em>group</em>.&#160; We were social creatures in the end.&#160; Easier to be one tinker in a small army of tinkers than a tinker all alone.</p>\n<p>Heads were turning my way, a few fingers pointing.&#160; Angry mutters.&#160; Clairvoyants, precogs, people with future sight, all of them finding me.&#160; If the lynch mob came for me, there wasn&#8217;t a lot I could do.&#160; Glaistig U- the Faerie Queen was among them, and she was <em>mad</em>.</p>\n<p>If she turned her power on me, hit me with anything <em>close</em> to what she&#8217;d used while I was at the height of my power, I was a goner.</p>\n<p>There were a <em>lot</em> of capes out there who didn&#8217;t like being made into puppets.&#160; I suspected that more than a few of them had been victim to it in the past.&#160; Yet others were used to being the ones in control.&#160; Lung, Teacher, the child surgeon.</p>\n<p>I counted myself lucky that I&#8217;d made it even this far.&#160; That things <em>hadn&#8217;t</em> devolved into chaos the moment the leashes came off.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d set myself apart, a little distance away.&#160; The original plan had been to maintain a vantage point where I could watch the battle unfold.&#160; Now it was a refuge, as if capes who could bring cities to their knees hesitated to expend the time and energy to close the distance to me.</p>\n<p>I dropped to my knees, still holding on to the clairvoyant, much as I&#8217;d hold on to a life preserver while underwater.</p>\n<p>Standing was hard.&#160; I needed a chance to rest, to think.</p>\n<p>Except <em>thinking</em> was harder still.&#160; I was a husk, and things were rotting from the inside out.&#160; I&#8217;d hoped I&#8217;d recuperate some when I had less people in my control, but it didn&#8217;t seem like it worked out that way.&#160; Damage done was damage done.&#160; One section of my brain was swelling or creeping out to take over other sections, like it had overwritten dog-girl&#8217;s social perceptions.</p>\n<p>If I could have talked, if I could have communicated, I could have told them.&#160; I could have explained how we could make it all work if we just worked together, if we <em>coordinated</em>.&#160; I would have offered myself up for them to do with as they saw fit, if they&#8217;d just cooperate <em>now</em>.&#160; I&#8217;d made the choice for others, sacrificing them rather than letting them choose to sacrifice themselves.&#160; If someone in that crowd was angry enough to give me a fate worse than death, it was probably deserved.</p>\n<p>Though probably not equitable.&#160; I moved my hand to my face, the clairvoyant holding my wrist.&#160; I&#8217;d taken my mask off at some point.&#160; When had I done that?&#160; My hand ran clumsily down past my eye, my cheekbone, nose, and mouth, every movement trembling.&#160; It didn&#8217;t feel real.&#160; Like it was a mask I was wearing.</p>\n<p>I dug my fingernails in as I caught my lip and chin.&#160; Numb.&#160; I could <em>feel</em>, but it was so small a sensation compared to all of the people I&#8217;d been controlling.&#160; I saw it from a distance, to the point that I felt like I was barely <em>there</em>.&#160; I&#8217;d be willing to sacrifice myself if it meant saving <em>everything</em>, but that wasn&#8217;t much of an offer, when my life was already pretty much gone.&#160; I didn&#8217;t have anything left.</p>\n<p>Not that I was free to suggest it, in any event.</p>\n<p>I would have explained my strategy.&#160; A way to win, if we could get the pieces in motion.&#160; I would have rallied them, tried to get them on board.&#160; Even told them, knowing I&#8217;d be gunned down an instant later.&#160; But I was mute, incomprehensible.</p>\n<p>There was only one option left to me.&#160; One I didn&#8217;t like in the slightest.</p>\n<p>I shifted my position, and I sat on the edge of the roof, my bugs thick enough around me that a sniper would have a hard time taking a shot.</p>\n<p>I waited.</p>\n<p>The assembled capes below were getting more restless.&#160; They spoke different languages, finding others in their number who spoke the same.&#160; Voices were tight with anger and stress.&#160; Some of it would be directed at me.&#160; Others&#8230;</p>\n<p>There was an advantage here.&#160; Another reason they hadn&#8217;t scattered.&#160; So much of our dwindling morale was due to the fact that we hadn&#8217;t been able to <em>affect</em> Scion.&#160; We hit him, and nothing seemed to work.&#160; At best, we had knocked him off balance.</p>\n<p>They hadn&#8217;t seen me drop the bombs.&#160; They hadn&#8217;t been fully cognizant of what was going on with Scion expending power to view the future, or even that we were wearing him down on a level.&#160; There <em>was</em> a limit to how much damage he could sustain.</p>\n<p>The saving grace had been the psychological impact they&#8217;d witnessed.&#160; Scion <em>hurting</em>.&#160; Seeing his reaction to glimpsing the other being.</p>\n<p>Maybe they didn&#8217;t understand it.&#160; Maybe they did.&#160; But I suspected it was a factor in morale.&#160; They&#8217;d seen a <em>reaction</em>.</p>\n<p>It was key, that reaction.</p>\n<p>Now I was in an awkward position.&#160; Unable to act, unable to access the specific capes I needed.&#160; I had far, far more enemies than allies.&#160; Beyond that fight from <em>without</em>, I had to wage a war <em>within</em>, struggling against my mind and body.</p>\n<p>I was losing things.&#160; I struggled to find a point of reference.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m a monster, </em>I thought.&#160; Not an anchor, but a recent memory, a realization that was still fresh in my memory.&#160; Something from just before I&#8217;d started losing memories.</p>\n<p><em>Bullet ants.</em></p>\n<p><em>Maggots in eyeballs.&#160; Necrotizing flesh.&#160; Strip- stripping flesh from bone.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hand or knee?</em></p>\n<p>The images were so clear in my mind&#8217;s eye that I could almost see them around me.&#160; A hero in his civilian clothes, gasping for breath.&#160; I had the means to save him, and I was holding back.</p>\n<p>I heard a voice, female, kind words, spoken haltingly, out of place in the midst of this.&#160; I had trouble placing the memory.</p>\n<p>Then, more reassuring in a way, a return to the more violent thoughts.&#160; <em>Me standing over a man, pulling a trigger and watching the aftermath, bits of skull, brain and blood painting the pavement beneath him.</em></p>\n<p><em>The dance of bugs within a woman&#8217;s lungs, minimizing the surface area available, limiting oxygen.</em></p>\n<p>A very different, very <em>abstract</em> way of killing.</p>\n<p>Again, the voice interrupted.&#160; Patient, almost like I was overhearing something being said.&#160; It made for a kind of&#8230; what was the word?&#160; A conflict between two ideas.&#160; <em>Dis- Dissonance</em>.</p>\n<p>I tried to pick it apart, and in the doing, I realized what was happening.</p>\n<p>With the loss of the portals, I&#8217;d lost one more anchor.&#160; Pride, confidence, that reminder of who I&#8217;d been when I&#8217;d been a warlord, when I&#8217;d been at my most powerful, recent circumstances excepted&#8230; I&#8217;d inadvertently connected thoughts and memories to that, and now that the physical manifestation was gone, those thoughts were disappearing with it.&#160; My identity was degrading.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t be sure that anything I was reaching for was <em>real</em>, or if I was taking something minor and exaggerating it in importance.</p>\n<p>The Faerie Queen had been right.&#160; If she hadn&#8217;t warned me, if she hadn&#8217;t told me I needed something to hold on to, I wasn&#8217;t sure where I&#8217;d be right this instant.</p>\n<p>I reached out, searching for other anchors.</p>\n<p>The dog girl.&#160; Her pet wolf had been changed into the alien &#8216;garden&#8217;, and her view of it had been cut off when she&#8217;d retreated through a doorway.&#160; She was staring at the empty space where the doorway had been.</p>\n<p>Her teammate- <em>my</em> teammate, had a phone out, and was talking and typing at the same time, while her eyes roved over the crowd.</p>\n<p>She had only the two pairs of eyes, while I had limited, local omniscience.&#160; We were each seeing the same thing through very different perspectives.&#160; Unease, restlessness.</p>\n<p>Here and there, people were breaking down.&#160; Tears, panic.&#160; The ones who had avoided the battle in the first place, the ones from distant Earths who had no conception of what was going on, the retirees.</p>\n<p>Except they had support.&#160; They weren&#8217;t entirely alone.</p>\n<p>I felt a measure of resentment.&#160; I tried to dismiss it, but it didn&#8217;t budge.</p>\n<p><em>Alone.&#160; A freak.&#160; Crazy.&#160; Broken.&#160; Unhinged.</em></p>\n<p>I had no fucking <em>time</em>, but I was paralyzed until <em>someone else</em> made the first move.&#160; If I stepped in now, I&#8217;d disturb the frail peace and tranquility that kept the group stable.&#160; They&#8217;d rally against me.</p>\n<p>I watched the monsters and the lunatics.&#160; The tentacle girl was hanging back, hiding inside an apartment, trying to calm herself.&#160; There was a cape from the Birdcage who was pacing.&#160; When I&#8217;d picked him up, I dimly recalled, he&#8217;d been all alone, occupying one wing with two others.</p>\n<p>I saw the trio of furies, on the fringes.&#160; Pale, and somehow not even remotely human.&#160; They reveled in chaos, and so long as&#160;<em>one</em> lived, the others would come back.&#160; Over and over.&#160; As allies, they&#8217;d be useful, as enemies, they could and would deliver the critical, crippling blow that spoiled all our efforts.</p>\n<p>The Faerie Queen was being very quiet and very still, but one of her puppets was tracking my location.&#160; The most dangerous one of all.&#160; Dangerous to all of us, not just <em>me</em>.&#160; I scarcely mattered at this point.</p>\n<p>There was only the message I needed to communicate.&#160; I&#8217;d seen it all, I&#8217;d seen what worked and what didn&#8217;t.&#160; I had an idea of what we needed to <em>do</em>.</p>\n<p>I bit my lip, hard, as if the pain could help me focus, bring me closer to being <em>me</em>.</p>\n<p>Watch, observe, wait.</p>\n<p>Scion was killing the serpent-Endbringer&#8230; <em>Leviathan</em>.&#160; Pummeling his chest, shattering it.&#160; Cracks radiated from the wound, glowing gold.&#160; Scion&#8217;s face was twisted in fury, his fury was that of a berserker.&#160; The blows were heavy enough that they drove Leviathan into the shattered earth below.&#160; Water was flowing in around them, Leviathan&#8217;s element, but the attack continued, the glowing wounds creating <em>mountains</em> of steam around them.</p>\n<p>Leviathan managed to get one fin to make contact with Scion, and the resulting disintegration created nearly as much mist, redoubling the effect.</p>\n<p>The winged Endbringer advanced through the steam and golden-crimson mist, moving the one gun she still carried through the air until it was aimed at the two.</p>\n<p>She fired, and it blasted a gust of wind at them, strong enough to push them and clear the wind.</p>\n<p>The smallest Endbringer, flying in the air, unloaded a laser, three of its shadow pets&#8217; attacks and two more ranged powers on the golden man.&#160; The resulting blast sent the ruined fragments of the settlement and the remains of the surrounding terrain spraying into the air.</p>\n<p>The resulting crater that compared with the one Leviathan had made in the real Brockton Bay.</p>\n<p>The blast had separated the two, leaving Leviathan hunched over, one arm intact and braced against the ground, head hanging, his chest peeled open.</p>\n<p>Scion merely shifted his orientation in the air.&#160; Not even shaking himself, not pausing to find his balance.&#160; He was roaring, screaming, and in his thrashing movements, his blind fury, I nearly missed it.&#160; In the moment he returned to an upright position, he flung out a sphere of golden light.</p>\n<p>The light curved in the air, and punched into Leviathan&#8217;s open chest cavity.</p>\n<p>The Endbringer fell.&#160; The color went out of Leviathan, his flesh breaking up, like clay overbaked in a kiln.&#160; The fins were the first thing to crumble, the rest of his body following suit.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;d <em>taunted</em> him.&#160; Teased him with the one thing he wanted most in the world, then we&#8217;d taken it away.</p>\n<p>He turned his attention to the winged Endbringer and her smaller companion.&#160; The towering Endbringer was already so damaged that she could only pull herself together.&#160; The fat Endbringer was gone.</p>\n<p>No, he was alive.&#160; He&#8217;d created a time field around himself, and was healing in a more distant location.</p>\n<p>Scion was doing too much damage to them.&#160; They wouldn&#8217;t win this fight for us.</p>\n<p>No, it was the least of us, the smallest of us, which could have the biggest impact.&#160; Capes I&#8217;d overlooked <em>entirely</em>.</p>\n<p>I blinked.&#160; No, even more than that, individuals I was thinking of as useless, even now.</p>\n<p>I knew what I had to do.</p>\n<p>In the crowd, people were getting more outspoken.&#160; Arguments had broken out.&#160; Harsh words, criticisms.&#160; Divisions were forming in the squads.&#160; Almost all of them were divisions centered around certain individuals.&#160; Virtually all of those individuals were ones who didn&#8217;t play well with others.</p>\n<p>It was a man in gold and black armor who stepped to the fore, a sultry looking woman following right behind him.&#160; He shouted out, and his voice echoed, drawing attention from the majority of the crowd.</p>\n<p>That would have to do.</p>\n<p>With so little time to spare, I&#8217;d settle for a distraction.</p>\n<p>One floor below me, a chute had been deployed.&#160; Reaching twenty stories to the ground, it was arranged to let people on the upper floors evacuate quickly.&#160; People would slide down, and the natural curve of the chute as it was pulled away from the building would keep them from being turned into a paste.</p>\n<p>I used my relay bugs to extend my range, sent my swarm out, and then began securing it myself, tying the end to nearby architecture.&#160; It was set up by the time we&#8217;d made our way inside the building and to the far end of the hall.</p>\n<p>The faerie woman had noticed I was moving, but her attention was partially on the man in armor.&#160; She was holding back.</p>\n<p>I was preparing to go down with the clairvoyant, making sure we wouldn&#8217;t break contact even if we had a hard landing, when I heard that voice again, small and afraid.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t place the recollection.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t use my flight pack with a passenger, so I made my way down the chute, and I hoped the material of the chute would hold.&#160; I wasn&#8217;t worried about the threads, thin as they were.&#160; I knew spider thread.</p>\n<p>It was nice, knowing <em>something</em>, but I hesitated to claim it as an anchor.&#160; It could be another misleading thing.</p>\n<p>And if I ended up with one thing tying me to reality, I didn&#8217;t want that one thing to be an obsession with bugs.</p>\n<p>Images crossed my mind, possibilities.&#160; If I still controlled <em>people</em>, but I&#8217;d gone down some ugly path like that&#8230;</p>\n<p>I saw myself, haggard, thin, with minions in a similar state.&#160; Eating bugs, wearing bugs and their materials, barely <em>human</em>, my mind more like an insect&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>I focused on my friends instead.&#160; Dog-girl and the girl with the phone.</p>\n<p>They were moving my way.&#160; Calling out to a girl who was getting her ruined hand stitched up by her partner.</p>\n<p>The pair raised their heads, but they hesitated to follow.</p>\n<p>A harsh word from the girl with the dogs got them into action.&#160; It would have made <em>me</em> move, and I didn&#8217;t understand what it meant.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d reached the end of the ramp.&#160; Perhaps not so gentle a landing as I&#8217;d hoped for, but it hadn&#8217;t injured me.&#160; I picked myself up and got moving in their direction.</p>\n<p>I was losing track of who people were.&#160; How were they supposed to be anchors when I couldn&#8217;t remember who they are, or why they meant something to me?</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t quite remember how she even knew I was coming.&#160; I hadn&#8217;t controlled her recently, and her power wasn&#8217;t fresh in my mind.</p>\n<p>It was with a measure of trepidation that I met up with them, the portal creator and clairvoyant following me.</p>\n<p>Eerie, to be in such a large city with no people around us.</p>\n<p>I could imagine how things would be if humanity was eliminated.&#160; All of these ruined cities moldering, slowly crumbling&#8230;</p>\n<p><em>W-why did I find it com-comf- why did it re-re-reassure me?</em></p>\n<p>Dangerous, to think that way.</p>\n<p>I was a tent in a strong wind, and the stakes were coming loose.&#160; Only one or two remained.&#160; Depending on the direction the wind was blowing when they were gone, someone could get hurt.</p>\n<p>A tent surrounded by bugs.&#160; Like this was a shitty camping trip.&#160; I smiled a little at the thought, a broken giggle slipping through my lips.</p>\n<p><em>N-no.&#160; St-stay c-ccentered.</em></p>\n<p>The slur in my own thoughts made a chill run down across my back.&#160; I pressed my hand to my head, as if I could <em>physically</em> shift things back into place, or keep them from coming apart.</p>\n<p>Again, that soft voice I couldn&#8217;t place, something to help me keep moving onward, a human sound when abstracts were becoming all too real.</p>\n<p>I realized the others were near, riding a dog.&#160; The ones riding the stuffed lizard-Endbringer had stopped at the midway point, no doubt keeping watch.</p>\n<p>The girl at the front flashed me a grin, raising a hand in a gesture I couldn&#8217;t quite grasp.</p>\n<p>She spoke, and I assumed it was a greeting.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t respond.&#160; Didn&#8217;t know how.&#160; We were separated by a gulf.</p>\n<p>She spoke as she spread her arms, raising her shoulders in an exaggerated set of movements.&#160; Like talking louder to a person who didn&#8217;t speak the language.&#160; What was the fucking point?</p>\n<p>She pointed at me, then in the direction of the crowd, then made the same movement.</p>\n<p><em>The giant monsters are losing to Scion</em>, I thought.&#160; <em>He&#8217;s coming, soon</em>.</p>\n<p>I took her cue and started walking forward.&#160; She hopped off the dog, <em>scrambling </em>to get in my way, barring my path, her arms spread.</p>\n<p>I stopped.</p>\n<p>Her expression was <em>stark</em>, rigid, wide eyed.&#160; Her arms spread, she repeated the gesture a third time, arms and shoulders rising, then falling.</p>\n<p>When I didn&#8217;t respond, she spoke, her head cocked a little to one side.</p>\n<p>I could hear the voice again.</p>\n<p>Another person appeared twenty or so feet to my left, startling me.&#160; My bugs moved, creating a barrier.</p>\n<p>No.&#160; She was a familiar face, so to speak.&#160; A gray mask, horned, with mischievous eyes, a mouth hidden by a scarf or cowl&#160; she&#8217;d piled around her shoulders.&#160; She was the source of the voice.&#160; She&#8217;d been with me, keeping me company.</p>\n<p>Tears came unbidden to my eyes.</p>\n<p>The blonde girl touched her cheek, pitching her voice high at the end.&#160; A question?</p>\n<p>The girl with the horned mask responded, gesturing in my direction.</p>\n<p>I adjusted the clairvoyant&#8217;s grip, then touched my cheek.&#160; I was bleeding.&#160; I had a gouge at the corner of my mouth, and my finger came away with blood on it.</p>\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;d scratched myself, earlier.&#160; I hadn&#8217;t realized.&#160; Hadn&#8217;t meant to.</p>\n<p>My hand shook as I stared down at it.</p>\n<p>Alone, but not alone.&#160; Isolated, but not isolated.</p>\n<p>I needed to move, to go on.&#160; Damn the consequences, damn whatever could happen to me.&#160; If I could just get him to-</p>\n<p>The dog girl spoke from her seat on the giant, monstrous dog&#8217;s back.&#160; Not a sentence, but a single word, clearly spoken to get my attention.</p>\n<p>I raised my head to meet her eyes.&#160; Her hair was shaggy, her gaze intense behind the mop of brown-red hair.</p>\n<p>She held my gaze, silent, for long seconds.</p>\n<p>Then she reached down, grabbing a loop of chain that was strapped to the dog&#8217;s back.&#160; She reared back until it looked like she was going to fall off, then heaved it forward.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t fly <em>that</em> far, but it landed partway between us, closer to her than to me.</p>\n<p>I advanced, and the entire group collectively backed away.&#160; Only the girl with the horns, behind me, advanced a little.</p>\n<p>I reached down, the clairvoyant&#8217;s hand on my arm, and I grabbed the chain.</p>\n<p>I gave the chain to Doormaker.&#160; He gripped it, and then he parted from me.</p>\n<p><em>It&#8217;s the ones I was dismissing entirely that are most important</em>, I thought.</p>\n<p>I backed away, and she began reeling in the chain.&#160; I walked him forward until he was out of my range, in their company instead of mine.</p>\n<p>The dog girl didn&#8217;t break eye contact.&#160; She was watching me carefully.</p>\n<p>She pointed at me, then at the sky.</p>\n<p>No, not the sky, at bugs.</p>\n<p>Me&#8230; bugs?</p>\n<p>Herself, then the dog.</p>\n<p>Then at the portal man&#8230; and, very slowly, taking her time, she pointed a door, as if unsure.</p>\n<p>What did she mean?</p>\n<p>Our respective powers?&#160; Power?</p>\n<p>She was asking about his power?</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t know about his power.&#160; But it wasn&#8217;t important.&#160; I didn&#8217;t care about his power.&#160; It was secondary.&#160; If they could fix it, it would help, but I doubted I&#8217;d be able to take control of people so easily.&#160; Not a second time.</p>\n<p>No.&#160; I touched my hand to my mouth, then to my forehead.</p>\n<p>I gestured towards him, then repeated the combination.</p>\n<p>I drew a line with my bugs, pointing towards the crowd.</p>\n<p><em>P-p-please on-unddersttand</em>.</p>\n<p>The girl with the red-brown hair was nodding slowly.</p>\n<p>She started to speak, but the blonde cut her off.&#160; The blonde sounded annoyed, hurt, a little upset, but not in a bad way.&#160; When she looked at me, her eyes were kind.&#160; She brought the portal man to her and hooked one of her arms through his.</p>\n<p>She understood, I was almost positive.&#160; She cared, and I <em>was</em> positive.&#160; That annoyance, that hurt, it was only because she wanted to be the one who understood me and communicated with me, even in this rudimentary way.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t the only one who&#8217;d seen everything unfold.&#160; The portal man had been there, linked to the clairvoyant through me.&#160; He&#8217;d watched what I&#8217;d watched.&#160; They could find a way to communicate with him, and they could get clues out of him, answers.</p>\n<p>In the other Earth, the winged Endbringer fell from high above, her innumerable wings broken, ruined and bent.&#160; She reached skyward, as if clutching for Scion, high above, and then the hand crumbled.</p>\n<p>The rest of her followed suit.</p>\n<p>The others were too broken to fight.</p>\n<p><em>S-ssionns c-comminng.</em></p>\n<p>I was losing the ability to think in concrete words.&#160; Needed- needed to get myself in a position where I could fight.</p>\n<p>I took a step forward, and the others reacted.&#160; This time, the auburn-haired girl had her dog move out of the way, off to one side.&#160; The blonde didn&#8217;t move.</p>\n<p>In the distance, the faerie girl turned her head.&#160; She&#8217;d noticed me move, somehow.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>I knew what I was doing.&#160; It was dangerous, yes, but so was Scion.</p>\n<p>I almost stepped forward to control her, to move her out of the way myself.&#160; Then I remembered that she was my anchor.&#160; One of the few I had remaining.</p>\n<p>What did I wind up as, if she was my only anchor?&#160; If I could so readily envision myself as the bug-obsessed freak, lurking in dark places, what did I become with her?</p>\n<p>Something close to human, at least?</p>\n<p>She&#8217;d saved me, in a way.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t remember how, but I remembered that much.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t touch her.&#160; I didn&#8217;t even <em>dare</em>.</p>\n<p>She gestured with the&#8230; <em>phone</em>.&#160; She started talking.&#160; Not communicating in basics, but taking a shotgun approach, not stopping, trying everything, in the hopes that <em>something</em> got through.</p>\n<p>Scion stepped through into another world.&#160; I&#8217;d covered our retreat in a fashion, but he was finding his way.</p>\n<p>The moment he left Earth Gimel, the Simurgh scattered the mixed sand and dirt she&#8217;d gathered above her, then climbed to her feet, gun in hand.&#160; The pieces of the fake body she&#8217;d formed of the materials at hand broke apart as they fell free.&#160; She waited, recuperating.</p>\n<p>It took seconds before he appeared in <em>our</em> world.&#160; The chaos was immediate.&#160; People running, people moving forward to fight.</p>\n<p>Glaistig Uaine cast one glance my way, then joined the fight.</p>\n<p>It was time.</p>\n<p>I picked up my phone, then used my bugs to carry it to her.&#160; She gave me a strange look I couldn&#8217;t interpret.</p>\n<p>The bugs moved the string, and it tapped against her phone.</p>\n<p>She typed something on my phone.&#160; I brought it back to me.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t understand the characters, but it looked like she&#8217;d done what I wanted.&#160; The phone was set up to call her, when I needed to call her.</p>\n<p>I could only hope that she understood when I started calling her.&#160; She&#8217;d been reluctant to help before, hadn&#8217;t she?&#160; And now, when everything was on the line&#8230;</p>\n<p>I trusted her.</p>\n<p>A noise made everyone&#8217;s heads turn.&#160; The man in gold and black armor had fired his weapon, and it had clipped a building.</p>\n<p>Dust from the toppled building filled the street.</p>\n<p>I moved.&#160; I could see where my blonde friend was, where the others were.&#160; I slipped by her in the chaos.</p>\n<p><em>Ittt&#8217;sss ttimmme</em>.&#160; My own voice was a buzz in my head, a medley of discordant sounds only barely resembling words.</p>\n<p>Time to fight, gathering my forces.&#160; Not an army this time.</p>\n<p>I broke into a run, best as I was able.&#160; Where my own feet failed me, my flight pack kept me aloft.</p>\n<p>I could see <em>everyone</em>, even in the dust.&#160; The clairvoyant let me see as if I was looking from every perspective, everywhere.&#160; It was easy to collect the first few I encountered.</p>\n<p>The girl with the mangled hand and her partner, riding the stuffed lizard.</p>\n<p>A sharp right.&#160; Moving around the perimeter of the flight.&#160; The faerie was busy fighting, but if she saw an opportunity, there was a good chance she&#8217;d kill me.</p>\n<p>There were others, but I was having trouble keeping track.&#160; I knew them by their powers.&#160; Brutes, hanging back.&#160; Tough enough to weather most fights, but barely capable of holding up against <em>Scion</em>.</p>\n<p>That took a special kind of toughness.</p>\n<p>A woman covered in a skin of forcefields, protecting people with massive shards of forcefield.</p>\n<p>I passed them, making a beeline for someone else, flying over the cloud of dust, trying to see people.&#160; She&#8217;d been doing rescue before, getting people to where they could be helped.</p>\n<p>Now&#8230; now she was a tool I needed if I was going to win this.&#160; We climbed onto the stuffed lizard&#8217;s back.&#160; I bound the clairvoyant&#8217;s hand to mine, mindful of the damage that had been done last time.</p>\n<p>The stuffed animal climbed up the side of a ruined building.&#160; With the clairvoyant&#8217;s hand and feet and my own flight pack, we dismounted when we reached an opening large enough to hop through.</p>\n<p>The girl with the ruined hand shifted position, slumping over.&#160; They climbed up to the highest point they could reach, and then the girl who controlled the stuffed humanoid lizard called out, incoherent.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t get her to talk properly.</p>\n<p>So I had her wail instead, a frantic sound that was <em>justifiable</em> in how little sense it made.</p>\n<p>A girl with flying armor and bright yellow hair descended, ready to help the apparently wounded girl.</p>\n<p>When she got close enough to touch them, she fell within my power&#8217;s range.</p>\n<p>I brought her to me, the movements shaky and unfamiliar.&#160; Easier on autopilot, but I didn&#8217;t have time to wait for her to drift my way.&#160; Movements of the feet controlled movement direction and altitude.&#160; I brought her to me.</p>\n<p>Then I made her sing.</p>\n<p><em>Th-thin-think ab-abbboutt cc-courrrage.&#160; Aabbout m-mmovving fforrwarrd.</em></p>\n<p>I could only hope the song conveyed the right meaning, the right impulse.</p>\n<p>I pressed the biggest blue button to call my teammate with the number she&#8217;d set into the phone.</p>\n<p>It shifted to a video call.&#160; I saw her on the other side.</p>\n<p>How to even explain?&#160; To convey the next step?</p>\n<p>I used my bugs to illustrate.&#160; A mass at the center, pulses traveling to other nodes.&#160; To <em>every</em> other node.</p>\n<p>She said something.</p>\n<p>A minute passed.</p>\n<p>Something hit the ground hard enough that the building <em>swayed</em>.&#160; Not merely a shaking, but a side-to-side wobble that suggested that anything harder might see the entire thing tip over.</p>\n<p>And the song began playing, echoing, through three other phones in my immediate vicinity.&#160; Two held by the ones who&#8217;d been on the stuffed animal, and a third-</p>\n<p>I was distracted before I could look for the source.&#160; My clairvoyance told me there wasn&#8217;t anyone nearby.</p>\n<p>All through the battlefield, Protectorate members and Wards had phones playing the song.&#160; It gave them strength, courage at a moment they felt weak.</p>\n<p>A woman I recognized from Brockton Bay threw the phone aside, then shot it with a shotgun, before changing the gun to something else and opening fire on Scion.&#160; It took the man in gold and black armor a second to get a chance to do the same.&#160; One of his underlings, a cape who was named after a siege weapon, took his boss&#8217; lead.</p>\n<p>It served as something to urge people onward, to focus them on one target.&#160; But those three, or those <em>two</em> were savvy enough to know something could be up.</p>\n<p>We moved.&#160; The armored girl with yellow hair helping to hold the clairvoyant while I descended to the ground with my flight pack.</p>\n<p>The movements of the other two weren&#8217;t coordinated well with my own movements.&#160; They rode the stuffed animal as it leaped to the next building, but momentarily passed out of my control.</p>\n<p>They didn&#8217;t turn on me, didn&#8217;t shoot me.&#160; They carried onward, and I adjusted my course to put them in my range again.</p>\n<p>I got the one-horned woman who glittered with forcefields, then changed direction.</p>\n<p>The next group was harder.&#160; They had advance warning we were coming, shared by a brown haired girl who wore a black dress and no mask.</p>\n<p>I felt a pang of emotion.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t even put a name to it.</p>\n<p>The girl rattled off words, <em>numbers, </em>in response to questions asked by a woman with body armor and a bristling ponytail.&#160; Monstrous capes moved to flank her, protecting her.</p>\n<p>Every second counted.</p>\n<p>Couldn&#8217;t give the precog a chance to get hard numbers.&#160; With every moment that passed, every loping movement of the stuffed lizard that followed beneath me, the pair exchanged question and answer.</p>\n<p>I was a threat.&#160; I was being reduced to numbers.&#160; Success, failure.&#160; Nothing more.</p>\n<p>Which was all this really was.&#160; Only I was focused on success and failure on a much bigger scale than this confrontation.</p>\n<p>The forcefield woman sandwiched each of us between two forcefields, then <em>willed</em> them forwards.&#160; We left the stuffed lizard behind.</p>\n<p>Three more questions, rapid fire.&#160; One word each, <em>names</em>.&#160; The woman with the mask only heard the first syllable of each response before moving on to the next.</p>\n<p>She gave a command, an order, and a red haired woman in a black skintight outfit turned, aiming her gun at a wall.</p>\n<p>The bullet ricocheted off the wall and flew right through our group.&#160; My forcefield woman went down, and the crystals we were riding fractured, coming apart enough that we fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>Only the string tying me to the clairvoyant kept us together.<em><br>\n</em></p>\n<p>A fat, bald man stepped forward, blocking my way with his body.&#160; A young man with orange skin, a tail and bright pink hair did the same.</p>\n<p>But the young precog said something, and stepped forward as they parted to give her room.</p>\n<p>She spoke, one word.&#160; My name.&#160; I was pretty sure.&#160; What was my name?&#160; did it start with a &#8216;T&#8217; sound?&#160; An &#8216;S&#8217;?&#160; A &#8216;W&#8217;?</p>\n<p>An &#8216;M&#8217;?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Murrruuh-hurrrrrrrrh,&#8221; I managed.&#160; I slowly pulled myself to my feet, my movements jerky, shaky.&#160; Worse than it had been yet.</p>\n<p><em>Y-youuu ss-set mme onnnnn th-thi-this roadddd.</em>&#160; <em>Y-youuu oh-owe mme thhhhhisss.&#160;&#160; Ddd-dohnn&#8217;t gg-get-t innn myy w-wayyy n-noww.</em></p>\n<p>Scion toppled a building.&#160; Capes erected barriers to protect a whole <em>squad, </em>over a hundred capes, but the building disintegrated on impact, rubble pouring off the barrier like water off a roof, crushing the people who didn&#8217;t have adequate shelter.</p>\n<p>She didn&#8217;t move, staring at me.</p>\n<p>I had the clairvoyant reach into my belt.&#160; She withdrew a scrap of paper.</p>\n<p>My bugs carried it to the young precog.</p>\n<p>An I.O.U., if there ever was one.</p>\n<p>She stared down at the two and a half words, then crumpled it.&#160; Her head hung.</p>\n<p>Before any of the others could stop her, she stepped forward, into my range.</p>\n<p>I pushed her <em>out</em>, the movement forceful enough she stumbled a bit.&#160; The fat one caught her.</p>\n<p>I pointed.</p>\n<p>The group parted, giving me a view of their other members.</p>\n<p>In the distance, Scion was struck, knocked into a building.&#160; The work of the man with the giant sword.&#160; The faerie readied to follow up, then hesitated.</p>\n<p>She flew my way instead.</p>\n<p>No time for grace or decorum.</p>\n<p>The woman with the forcefield scales used her power.&#160; Another sandwich of crystalline fields, the more secure way to hold someone, and she hauled the reality-warper out of the other group, into my range.&#160; Another forcefield caught a boy with glowing hair.</p>\n<p>The remainder dropped into fighting stances, a gun was trained on me-</p>\n<p>And the precog cried out.&#160; One word.&#160; Negation.</p>\n<p>They stopped in their tracks.</p>\n<p>I turned to go, my recruits in hand.&#160; The faerie girl was coming.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t fight.&#160; I had the key components.&#160; The trick was to set everything in motion.</p>\n<p>I accessed the power of the reality warper.&#160; The girl who got more powerful as she lost touch with the world, who could fashion her own realities, then bring them into our world.</p>\n<p>I had her create a door, then I used her partner&#8217;s help to smash it.</p>\n<p>A freestanding hole in reality.&#160; The reality warper used her power to pick a world.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t too picky.&#160; The instant I was through, I had them make two more.</p>\n<p>Then two more.</p>\n<p>I protected them all with forcefields.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t have the portal man, but I did have this as a means of traveling <em>sideways</em>, like Scion could travel in this direction that wasn&#8217;t up or down, left, right, forward or back.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t let me cross all the way into other continents.&#160; Movement was <em>analogous.</em></p>\n<p>Still, it made ambushing other groups easier.&#160; I could use the clairvoyant to see where we were in analogue to the other world, then smash a doorway open, putting me right next to whoever I wanted.&#160; The song helped keep them focused on Scion, kept people from running.&#160; It wasn&#8217;t perfect, absolute control, but it was a means of keeping us all together.</p>\n<p>Scion hadn&#8217;t done much planning for this eventuality.&#160; For a world where <em>everyone</em> was against him.&#160; In every world I&#8217;d glimpsed, we were fractured, whole nations worth of good capes hanging back or fighting with the others.&#160; He&#8217;d hidden the strategies from us, but I could connect the dots.</p>\n<p>It was about keeping him off guard, putting him on unfamiliar footing.</p>\n<p>I could only hope that <em>everyone</em> was enough people, right now.</p>\n<p>I found the boy who made hands and faces out of surrounding materials.&#160; A teammate, a friend.<em>&#160; </em>He&#8217;d worked with me on something important.<em><br>\n</em></p>\n<p>I put myself right in the middle of the group, collected him, and then left.</p>\n<p>When others moved to follow, I set another forcefield up, and retreated through a series of doors, leaving decoy doorways in my wake.</p>\n<p>The power booster, to give myself more control, and to enhance the song.&#160; To enhance the reality warper and everyone else I&#8217;d chosen.</p>\n<p>The girl who made her dreams into projections.</p>\n<p>The boy, her ex-friend, who could turn anything into a bullet.</p>\n<p>And then the man who could <em>connect</em> things, so the movement of one would move the other.&#160; I stepped through, and he was ready for me.&#160; He moved a short iron rod, and the partner rod caught me by the neck, pinning me to a wall.</p>\n<p>His partner dismissed the illusion.&#160; A displacement effect that made them appear to be where they weren&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>The <em>connection</em> man was more dangerous than he seemed.&#160; The rod that was pinning me would keep moving to the side if he kept moving his own rod.&#160; Even if there was stuff in the way.&#160; It might distort or break, but he wouldn&#8217;t feel any resistance on his end.</p>\n<p>My <em>throat</em> would probably break apart before the rod did.</p>\n<p>He spoke in broken English.&#160; Still more capable of speech than I was.</p>\n<p>I had the others behind me.&#160; The forcefield woman made a field behind him.&#160; He blocked it with another pair of rods that whipped up from the ground, connected to something in his sleeve.</p>\n<p>The telekinetic girl with the stuffed animals used threads, binding him.&#160; Another means of pulling him closer.</p>\n<p>A moment later, his cloak went rigid, fixing him to the ground.&#160; Other threads still bound his flesh, biting deep enough they threatened to draw blood.</p>\n<p>His partner used a power, and the threads moved five or six feet to the left.&#160; They recoiled to the telekinetic&#8217;s grasp.&#160; He backed away a step, keeping his distance from me, extending the connection between the rods so it stayed against my throat.</p>\n<p>The movement of things to one side wasn&#8217;t an illusion, or it wasn&#8217;t illusion <em>only</em>.&#160; Selective space redistribution, probably usable on <em>light</em>.</p>\n<p>He pressed me harder against the wall, speaking in a low, grave voice.</p>\n<p>If I could have <em>asked</em>, I would have asked.</p>\n<p>All at once, he staggered, and the pressure on my throat let up.</p>\n<p>A girl with a horned mask had appeared beside him, pulling his robe up around his head.&#160; She dragged him forward staggering, and heaved him into my range.</p>\n<p>A moment later, she was gone.</p>\n<p>I had all of the <em>individuals</em> I needed, though I had a hunch about another I&#8217;d left behind.</p>\n<p>I found one of the larger groups, then moved my army into position.&#160; A group of select individuals, to give me the powers I needed access to, all falling within sixteen feet of me.</p>\n<p>I formed the doorway, then broke it open.&#160; The final piece, for the time being.&#160; It was a group I&#8217;d initially dismissed, a group that had sat out on the battle.&#160; Now they came into play.</p>\n<p><em>Changers.</em></p>\n<p>Capes who could change their form, capes who could take on the faces of others.&#160; The clairvoyant and I dropped from a portal in the air and landed right in their midst.&#160; Crystalline forcefields appeared in the air, then lowered slowly enough that people had a chance to get out of the way.</p>\n<p>I picked the faces of every changer in my range, watching to make sure it was accurate.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t control them while they were outside of my range, so I&#8217;d do something cruder, instead.</p>\n<p>I chose their faces, and then I seated them on the crystalline forcefields, binding them in place with the connection man.</p>\n<p>I scattered them into the sky.&#160; Each one rooted to a forcefield platform.</p>\n<p>Then I tapped the reality warper&#8217;s power.&#160; I began shaping a world.</p>\n<p>I could see my blonde friend with the portal man, talking to people.&#160; Talking to&#8230; what was his name?&#160; The one who gave thinker powers.&#160; <em>Teacher</em>.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d given the portal man the ability to talk.</p>\n<p>A power I was afraid of taking for myself.&#160; Because I couldn&#8217;t lose even an iota of willpower if I was going to make it through this.&#160; Because I couldn&#8217;t fall into his grasp.&#160; Because I was afraid of finding out that even <em>he</em> couldn&#8217;t help me.</p>\n<p>The portal man would explain what he&#8217;d seen.&#160; With luck, my brilliant friend would be able to connect the dots.</p>\n<p>The reality warper&#8217;s world was shaped.&#160; Crude, but I could use the same piece over and over again.</p>\n<p>A landscape of body parts, of hands and limbs, of faces.</p>\n<p>I used my friend, the young man who could create hands and faces.</p>\n<p>I began altering the city.</p>\n<p>Scion was in the midst of fighting a monstrous, hulking dragon-man and the warlord with the death-eating shadow.&#160; He saw the first of the faces that the reality-manipulator had created and lashed out, demolishing it.</p>\n<p>The dragon-man took advantage of the opening to burn him.</p>\n<p><em>Hhhe&#8230; nno f-filtttterrrs.&#160; Hhhhhisss emmmotions&#8230; rrrraww.</em></p>\n<p>Scion fought his way free, and the warlord went on the offensive, lashing out.&#160; She&#8217;d collected the bodies of the dead, as the faerie girl had collected their &#8216;spirits&#8217;.&#160; She was strong, though not quite as strong as she would have been if things hadn&#8217;t gone sour.</p>\n<p>He tore into h- her pet and the damage was permanent.&#160; She pressed forward anyways, forcing him to retreat above the skyline.</p>\n<p>He came face to face with the changers.&#160; Wearing his companion&#8217;s face.&#160; The face of the alabaster-skinned companion my friends had put together, other faces like them.&#160; Companions that <em>could be</em>.&#160; One metal-skinned boy I&#8217;d salvaged from the ruins of a recent fight had been molded into a steel-skinned companion.&#160; Another was a female mirror of Scion himself, golden skinned.</p>\n<p>He moved to strike out, and I hurried to get them out of the way, using the connections and the forcefields to move them to the safest places I could find.</p>\n<p>Some were catching on, changing back.&#160; Others weren&#8217;t so quick in their ability to change.</p>\n<p>This wasn&#8217;t an attack on his body.</p>\n<p>I was going after his mind, his emotions.</p>\n<p>If the feelings were still raw after thirty years, if he hadn&#8217;t learned how to handle it, then I&#8217;d target that as his weak point.</p>\n<p><em>Sstrennggtthhth wwwwee h-have&#8230; y-yy-you ddo nottt&#8230;&#160; w-we d-dealll&#8230; with-thth l-lotsss&#8230; painnn inn-n&#8230; ou-ouhhrr livv-ves.</em></p>\n<p>Remind him of what he didn&#8217;t have.&#160; His partner, his&#8230; life cycle.</p>\n<p>Hands of stone emerged from around the city.&#160; More of reality warped around us.&#160; When she&#8217;d changed everything in her range into a simulation of the &#8216;garden&#8217;, I turned it into a portal, changed the chan-chann- station to something where it was all solid.&#160; Rock, ice, dirt.</p>\n<p>Then I moved her somewhere else, and started over.</p>\n<p>All around Scion, piece by piece, the world was changing.</p>\n<p>So much, so fast&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t all on my end.</p>\n<p><em>Mm-m- my ff-frrriennndsss.</em></p>\n<p>They&#8217;d connected the dots.&#160; They saw what I was doing and they were getting others on board.&#160; Illusions crafted of smoke.&#160; A space warper who could mold buildings was making faces.</p>\n<p>Maybe they even saw my end goal.</p>\n<p>My feelings swelled, and the faint singing that was echoing through the various phones seemed to mimic that.&#160; Was that my control being reflected through her?&#160; Or was it something on her end?</p>\n<p>He was reacting.&#160; Spending as much time destroying the landscape as he was on <em>us</em>.</p>\n<p>It was a sh-shift in our favor, and he was getting more agitated with every passing second.</p>\n<p>We were approaching a critical point.</p>\n<p>I pulled the changers back, and I moved to the location of some masters instead.</p>\n<p>Projection capes.&#160; Only a few.&#160; But it helped.&#160; I had the girl who made dreams into projections, and a clone-hybrid of two of the killers, capable of making poisonous, noxious illusions out of the landscape.</p>\n<p>I put her power to work, showing her what to do, then sending her to work, beyond my range.</p>\n<p>The song helped.&#160; The song meant that when I <em>pushed</em>, they kept moving.</p>\n<p>By the time the impulse and momentum wore off, they were well on their way, and I was gone.</p>\n<p><em>Nn-neckxt&#8230; n-nexttt.</em></p>\n<p>I took a step, and my leg gave way.</p>\n<p>I tried to stand, and it failed me again.</p>\n<p>The ones I controlled helped me to my feet.&#160; I leaned on them as they supported me.</p>\n<p><em>Neh-next</em>, I thought, again.</p>\n<p>My body was failing on me.</p>\n<p>A part of me had hoped that when this was all over, I&#8217;d be able to retreat somewhere.&#160; I <em>knew</em> I&#8217;d have enemies, that there was no way I could show my face again.</p>\n<p>I could, I was pretty sure, get by with a good stockpile of books, a place in the middle of nowhere.&#160; Not <em>cold</em>, but maybe a place in the mountains or on some island.&#160; Retreat from the world.</p>\n<p>Then it had taken reading from me.</p>\n<p>It had taken my ability to understand language.</p>\n<p>My ability to express it.</p>\n<p>Now it took my body.</p>\n<p>My mind was sure to follow.</p>\n<p>The projections began to haunt him.&#160; They emerged from walls or crept around corners.&#160; Images of his deceased, slain partner.&#160; Images of others, which almost seemed to bother him <em>more</em>.</p>\n<p>If he was forming any kind of tolerance, it was slow.&#160; He wasn&#8217;t getting a chance to <em>breathe</em>.</p>\n<p>Scion was striking down these constructions faster than I could raise them.</p>\n<p>Up until the moment the man in gold and black armor shot his sword at him.&#160; It bought time to put more of these illusions and constructions in place.</p>\n<p>Scion righted himself, then hesitated.</p>\n<p>Fury was giving way to a kind of <em>fear</em>.</p>\n<p>I knew this fear well.&#160; It was a fear that was all too easy to fall into when one&#8217;s focus was too narrow.&#160; To be caught up in an environment, facing down a relentless torrent of negative experiences.&#160; Even the minor things added up, if you couldn&#8217;t step back to look at things in perspective.</p>\n<p>He fought back.&#160; That was a fairly normal thing.&#160; A lot of people fought back when they faced something like this.&#160; A lot of people liked to think they could fight back up until it stopped.</p>\n<p>I limped forward, my squad in step around me, filling my power&#8217;s radius.</p>\n<p>Those types of people tended to underestimate the tenacity of the well and truly <em>fucked up&#160;</em>individuals of this world.</p>\n<p>It was lowly, to turn to <em>this</em>, but I&#8217;d never pretended to be honorable, above any of that.&#160; When shit was on the line, I&#8217;d go as far as I had to.</p>\n<p>I had the reality warper create another doorway.&#160; Her buddy knocked it open, and she tuned it back to our original er-</p>\n<p>Ear-</p>\n<p><em>Earth.</em></p>\n<p>The stuttering thoughts paralyzed me for a moment.&#160; I floated up a bit to see over the rank and file of my swarm, the clairvoyant holding on to my leg.</p>\n<p>My friends glanced up at me.&#160; I barely recognized them.</p>\n<p>I pointed at the portal.</p>\n<p>There was a short, fierce discussion.</p>\n<p>I felt my heartbeat pick up.&#160; Why weren&#8217;t they running?</p>\n<p>Scion was going to <em>snap</em>.&#160; He was going to destroy<em> ev-everything</em>.</p>\n<p>But my friend was talking into her phone.</p>\n<p>Scion was getting more frantic, a mix of fear and rage.</p>\n<p><em>Panic?</em></p>\n<p>Scope, scale, he was no longer reasonable about what was going on.</p>\n<p>If he&#8217;d been holding back so he could leave <em>some</em> of us alive, in the chance that another companion would show up and he would be able to resume his normal life cycle, then I was suspicious he was about to <em>stop</em>.</p>\n<p>And my friend continued talking into the phone, a stern expression on her face.&#160; She was tense.</p>\n<p>I tried to turn the clairvoyant on the scene, but the view was so narrow now, I wasn&#8217;t really able to see more than I could with my own eyes.&#160; I could choose where I saw <em>from</em>, but that didn&#8217;t help me evaluate the crowd.</p>\n<p>I could see the Endbringer arrive.&#160; I&#8217;d opened a portal to Gimel in the process of making mouseholes between worlds, and she was the only one that remained.</p>\n<p>She sang, a shrill song that echoed in every mind I controlled, her song joining the one that echoed from the phones on belts and in pockets.</p>\n<p>Then she began shaping the environment.&#160; Clouds of dust took on shapes, looming over Scion.</p>\n<p>Everywhere he turned, he faced reminders of what he&#8217;d lost, of a loss he couldn&#8217;t figure out how to handle.</p>\n<p>H-he was a member of a species that had won for however many cycles, utterly bewildered when we <em>drowned</em> it in its defeat.</p>\n<p>The winged Endbringer&#8217;s attack was the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back.&#160; He was hunched over in the air, hands on his head, knees against his chest, rotating as though gravity didn&#8217;t touch him, no conception of up, down, left or right.</p>\n<p>He was <em>shaking</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Any second.</em></p>\n<p>A slit of light appeared on the battlefield.&#160; It yawned open.</p>\n<p>Others began to follow.</p>\n<p><em>T-theyyyy fixxedd himmm.</em></p>\n<p>Except it wasn&#8217;t him.</p>\n<p>It was the faerie girl.&#160; She had him as a shadow-puppet.&#160; A ghost.</p>\n<p>I could hear my friend swear.&#160; The others around her were tense.</p>\n<p>They turned to run, sprinting through the portal.</p>\n<p>Thousands of doorways.&#160; She turned and looked in my direction.</p>\n<p>But nothing appeared nearby.</p>\n<p>The faerie girl was opening doorways for everyone <em>but us</em>.&#160; Everyone but <em>me</em>.&#160; People were running, fleeing into other worlds, and we were being left on our own.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t <em>cc-cllose</em> the portals I&#8217;d made with the reality warper.</p>\n<p>We ran, or the others ran, and I was mostly <em>carried.</em>&#160; We entered one world, then ducked into another door I&#8217;d left nearby.&#160; We zig-zagged between universes, using <em>realities</em> as cover.</p>\n<p>There was no <em>sound</em>.</p>\n<p>No scream, no explosion.</p>\n<p>It was a scouring light, no direction, no aim, nothing held back.</p>\n<p>The initial shockwave passed through doors, and it <em>expanded</em> in every direction with each door it passed through, sweeping past everything within ten miles of each portal.</p>\n<p>The moment we were through the last portal, I&#8217;d connected every member of the group to a forcefield.&#160; The forcefield was then <em>flung</em> forward, carrying us with it.</p>\n<p>Eased to a stop when we were out of range.</p>\n<p>When the light faded, there was only flatness and portals.</p>\n<p>I moved my hand to point, and my hand couldn&#8217;t make the gesture.&#160; My fingers refused to extend independently.&#160; I could see the hesitation on the faces of the others.</p>\n<p>But I could <em>see</em>.&#160; I could see what was going on.&#160; I led my squad forward, and the rest followed.</p>\n<p>I found the faerie queen, in the center of the group of rescued.&#160; Portals stood in concentric circles, with gaps so they could be navigated through.&#160; A stonehenge of glowing doorways.</p>\n<p>I walked, stopping in the middle of an open field.&#160; I watched.</p>\n<p>I saw Scion, just barely recovering.</p>\n<p>I saw the faerie girl, talking to others.</p>\n<p>I watched, and long seconds passed.&#160; Others around me were talking, just beyond my range.&#160; There was a voice in my ear, coaxing, asking questions.</p>\n<p>She banished two spirits, keeping the portal man.&#160; Picked two others.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t wait for them to fully materialize.&#160; I created a doorway with the reality-warper and kicked it open.</p>\n<p>I appeared right behind the faerie queen.</p>\n<p>I seized her, and I seized the portal man she&#8217;d killed and claimed for herself.</p>\n<p>I opened a doorway to Scion, and I unfolded a cloak of portals, capturing people.</p>\n<p>I found the tinkers I&#8217;d left on the other earth.</p>\n<p>When we emerged, he didn&#8217;t react.&#160; He was lost in his own mind.</p>\n<p>The dream-projector fell unconscious, and was captured by her onetime friend.&#160; A glimmering of the garden-entity.</p>\n<p>It loomed, rising into the air before Scion.</p>\n<p>He recoiled, striking at it.</p>\n<p>My <em>swarm</em>, feeble as it was, formed a reaching hand.&#160; He struck at that, in turn.&#160; The impact wasn&#8217;t as strong.&#160; A distraction, maintaining pressure, nothing more.</p>\n<p>I opened a doorway, and I found one individual I&#8217;d left behind.</p>\n<p>The boy with the changing faces.</p>\n<p>The number man had said he&#8217;d taken a dose that had been focused on helping the entities be <em>human</em>.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t change his face <em>intentionally</em>.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, I didn&#8217;t have to.</p>\n<p>I could <em>feel</em> Scion&#8217;s reaction, through my senses and the individuals I controlled.</p>\n<p>Hope.&#160; For just a second.&#160; Not even the faint hope he&#8217;d experienced with the fake my teammates had put together.</p>\n<p>Because somehow, this boy registered as being like this entity&#8217;s companion had been.&#160; Registering as the same state, as the power that made it so similar.</p>\n<p>In the moment that hope died, the girl with the injured hand used her power on the iron rods.&#160; Infused them with the energy he was afraid of.</p>\n<p>Those rods became projectiles, in another&#8217;s hands.</p>\n<p>His hope was gone, he was bewildered, scared.</p>\n<p>He didn&#8217;t try to dodge.&#160; He couldn&#8217;t or wouldn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>They impaled him.&#160; One in the head, one in the chest.</p>\n<p>The tinkers fired their weapon.&#160; An interdimensional ram turned into a gun.&#160; They&#8217;d finished it while they weren&#8217;t under my control.&#160; <em>Defiant</em> was the one ready at the switch.</p>\n<p>I discovered why he was concerned about the power.</p>\n<p>It kept things from being <em>contained</em>.&#160; I got a glimpse, a flash of a look into the world beyond him, a world he&#8217;d shut off, to which his body was the only conduit.</p>\n<p>The beam tore into him and into the well.</p>\n<p>I moved the portals, and the beam turned to scour more of the landscape beyond Scion.</p>\n<p>The Faerie Queen began to slip from my grasp.</p>\n<p>She knew what was happening, and she was forcing my power to affect her spirits.&#160; A single spirit.</p>\n<p>Breaking free.</p>\n<p>She moved her hand of her own volition.</p>\n<p>And then she was free.&#160; Inside my radius, but free.</p>\n<p>She turned to face me.&#160; I met her gaze, as best as I was able.&#160; My vision wavered.</p>\n<p>Her head hung.&#160; She made no move to resist.&#160; She didn&#8217;t close the portals.</p>\n<p>More projectiles, opening more doors.</p>\n<p>The beam ran out of power.</p>\n<p>The dead remains of the entity showered the ground at the center of the wasteland.</p>\n<p>I staggered.&#160; The emotion around me was too much.&#160; I pushed people away, and they bumped into one another.&#160; Some left my range, only a handful remained.&#160; I didn&#8217;t recognize a single one.&#160; Even the one holding my hand.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t shake the feeling I&#8217;d somehow betrayed myself, and I wasn&#8217;t even sure who <em>I</em> was.</p>\n<p>It was over.&#160; And I was free to finally lose my mind.</p>\n'<h1 id="chap6">Speck 30.7</h1>b'<p>I was plunged into darkness.&#160; Things stopped making sense.</p>\n<p>I was surrounded.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t think straight because I couldn&#8217;t <em>think</em>.&#160; Trying to analyze people, to parse them, to identify them, it was like being in quicksand.&#160; Resistance to my efforts, getting nowhere, and always slowly, inevitably sinking.</p>\n<p>Thirty, forty, fifty people, more appearing every second, streamed through portals.&#160; All of the survivors, returning to the battlefield to see it for themselves.&#160; To turn their eyes towards <em>me</em>, because the only open space in the area was the space around <em>me</em>, the radius of my power, and it drew the eye.&#160; People noticed, and others paid attention to the <em>noticing</em>.</p>\n<p>The looks were hostile.&#160; All the worse because they <em>were alien</em>.&#160; Hundreds of people, and they didn&#8217;t feel any goodwill towards me.</p>\n<p>Strangers.&#160; Not strangers like people I didn&#8217;t <em>know.&#160;</em> That was different.&#160; Strangers who had <em>connections</em> to me, who I <em>still</em> didn&#8217;t know.&#160; Strangers like the masked man who broke into a house.&#160; Strangers in the sense of a stalker.&#160; Of a jury about to announce a sentence.</p>\n<p>This darkness around me, it was an absence of illumination, an absence of any light that could clarify and make sense of things.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t recognize anyone, put a finger on them as familiar or unfamiliar, enemy or ally.</p>\n<p>This&#8230; it was all ominous, vaguely threatening.&#160; People I might pass on the street wouldn&#8217;t pay me any mind.&#160; People <em>here,</em> almost every single one of them, they had a reason to pay attention to me, and the attention wasn&#8217;t <em>good</em> attention.</p>\n<p>Any of them, <em>all</em> of them, they could attack me at a moment&#8217;s notice.&#160; Inflict horrible tortures, kill me, fates worse than death.&#160; There were a <em>lot</em> of fates worse than death.</p>\n<p>I was settling into the end-state of my transition.&#160; I knew it, and I could see the dividing lines more clearly.&#160; What I could still do, what I couldn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Taking action, moving&#8230; easier so long as I had an objective.</p>\n<p>Objectives, too, were easier.&#160; I could still analyze.&#160; I could survey the battlefield, interpret powers, put two and two together.&#160; I could connect the dots, recall the powers I was up against, and I could form strategies.</p>\n<p>My head hung, but I could see the eyes of the people around me through the clairvoyant.&#160; They fixed their stares on me, and I could feel paranoia building.&#160; A weight, a <em>pressure</em>, crushing me from all sides.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t recognize anyone, only powers.&#160; Everyone was a potential enemy.</p>\n<p>Everyone was capable of using their powers to hurt me.</p>\n<p>Damn them all.&#160; After everything I&#8217;d done, everything I&#8217;d <em>given up</em>, and they were standing there, <em>threatening</em> me.</p>\n<p>Not a word was spoken, though the singing continued in the background.&#160; It conveyed the story to those who were still arriving.&#160; There were only two reasons things would be so still.&#160; The first was that battle could be utterly lost and there was no more need for orders, for communication, for cries of grief and screams of pain.&#160; That there was nothing left but surrender for the ones who remained.</p>\n<p>But this wasn&#8217;t that, I had to remind myself.&#160; We had <em>won</em>.&#160; That disbelief rocked each and every one of the people who were present, that silence marked a kind of respect for the fallen.</p>\n<p>And, all too possible, it marked a kind of unspoken agreement.&#160; I could see it.&#160; The silence was a relief and an added pressure, giving more weight to the eyes on me.&#160; Every pair of eyes was telling me the same thing.</p>\n<p>I was the next big threat.&#160; The next one that had to be killed before this could all <em>end</em>.</p>\n<p>I tensed.&#160; I could barely move, but I could still ready myself for a fight or flight response.&#160; Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t be able to stand, but I could use the device on my back, I could throw myself at the first opponent to approach me.</p>\n<p>I was lost in this special kind of darkness, but I could analyze this situation too.&#160; I could look at my capabilities and what my power had taken away, and I knew that there was a common theme at work.</p>\n<p><em>Con- conflict.&#160; </em>I could function so long as there was conflict, so long as I was creating it or resolving it.&#160; Given the choice between paralysis and conflict, I wondered if anyone would really choose the former, committing to it over time.</p>\n<p>Paralysis was a scary thing.&#160; There were a lot of forms of it, and they ranked up there as far as fates worse than death.</p>\n<p>Conflict was better.&#160; Familiar.</p>\n<p>My swarm informed me that I still had my knife, tiny legs tracing over the weapon&#8217;s grip.</p>\n<p>One tinker came through a doorway, as if to survey the situation.&#160; Heavy armored boots&#160;<em>rang</em> as they struck the glassy, blasted disaster area.&#160; The man emerged, and he cast a glance around.&#160; He took in, no doubt, the ruined buildings, the clouds of dust that were rolling <em>into</em> the clearing, still following the vast amounts of air that had crashed into the space to replace the atmosphere the blast had wiped out.</p>\n<p>The tinker pointed his weapon.&#160; The rest of the tinkers filed into this world, two by two.</p>\n<p>Everyone, just about, was making their way here.&#160; Thousands, now.</p>\n<p>Strangers.&#160; All of them would, circumstances demanding, aim to get in my way, to stop me, question my actions, <em>condemn</em> me, hate me, maim, torture or kill me.&#160; I&#8217;d seen good people go bad, couldn&#8217;t trust anyone.</p>\n<p>My memories were incoherent, but I could see the common themes, and I knew everything they could and would do, given the chance.&#160; Pyrokinetics could burn, telekinetics crush.&#160; They weren&#8217;t the scary ones, as painful as a burn or other injury could be.&#160; It was the thinkers that worried me, the masters, the <em>tinkers</em>.</p>\n<p>I watched that crowd with one eye.</p>\n<p>Some of them would kill me the second they thought they could get away with it.&#160; Others would be scheming.&#160; I had power, they wanted that power for themselves.&#160; They&#8217;d take it like my portal man was taken from me.&#160; They&#8217;d take <em>all</em> of it.</p>\n<p>My hand was clenched so hard I thought something might break.</p>\n<p>Had to remain still.&#160; I had a handful of soldiers, a swarm of sixteen people who&#8230;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d pushed them away, and these were the ones who I hadn&#8217;t pushed <em>out</em>.&#160; Why had I pushed them?</p>\n<p>Had I already been interfered with?&#160; Had someone already made a move, manipulating me?</p>\n<p><em>Rrreee-</em></p>\n<p>I shook my head a little.&#160; Couldn&#8217;t form complete thoughts.&#160; I felt a light weight on my shoulders, heard a voice.&#160; Reassuring, coaxing.</p>\n<p>So very small, compared to everything I was seeing, everything I was up against.&#160; The voice did nothing for me.</p>\n<p>I was prey in the sights of a predator.&#160; Frozen.&#160; When two snipers fought, the one who shot first was at a disadvantage.&#160; The other would see the muzzle flash and be on target.&#160; It was the same for me.&#160; My enemy would see the direction I was moving, the strategy I was putting to use, and they&#8217;d intercept me on both fronts.</p>\n<p>Being small and still helped.&#160; I wanted to cover myself, to hide in my swarm, big or little, but I couldn&#8217;t afford to move.</p>\n<p>Again, the voice.&#160; I shifted the clairvoyant&#8217;s grip, sliding it up from my wrist to my shoulder.&#160; Severing threads so the hand was free to move.&#160; Once it was on my shoulder, I moved it under a strap and used the cut threads to secure it in place.</p>\n<p>My hand was free.</p>\n<p>That singing-&#160; Singing was <em>bad</em>.</p>\n<p>But it wasn&#8217;t the- wasn&#8217;t the winged being that was perched on a building at the far end of the battlefield.&#160; She was silent, her wings folded over her shoulders and along the edge of the rooftop.&#160; Worse for wear, with wings broken, but her body was pristine alabaster, her hair blowing in the wind.</p>\n<p>The singing&#8230; it was one of my minions.&#160; The words had been faster in tempo before, now they were&#8230; I wasn&#8217;t even sure.</p>\n<p>Singing was <em>bad</em>, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>I silenced her.</p>\n<p>Stunning, to be in the middle of a city and not hear the roar of distant traffic, of conversation or anything of the sort.&#160; There was barely any wind, even, and no debris here for the wind to stir.</p>\n<p>There was only my swarm.&#160; A dull buzzing roar in my ears, for the smallest ones.&#160; I could sense the pounding heartbeats, feel the breathing.&#160; I could imagine the sounds so clearly that I couldn&#8217;t pick it apart from what I was actually hearing.&#160; Periodically, I could hear a voice, which was the same in some ways.&#160; In my head or in my ears?</p>\n<p>Muscles <em>creaked</em> when moving.&#160; For some, bones <em>ground together</em><em>.&#160; </em>Joints popped.&#160; Stomachs gurgled.</p>\n<p>My swarm had formed a loose ring around me, more by accident or manipulation than by any <em>design</em> on my part.&#160; There was a gap just beyond them, where others were afraid to cross.&#160; The noises of their bodies, the sensations, the perceptions&#8230; they were an island of forced familiarity in a sea of hostility.</p>\n<p>If even one <em>wave</em> of that sea hit me and my island&#8230; if they charged, if someone gave them an excuse&#8230;</p>\n<p>I repositioned my hand, a shaky, uneven movement.&#160; One side of my wrist pressed against the butt-end of my knife.</p>\n<p>The last of the phones finished relaying the music.&#160; Only two seconds had passed?&#160; If that.&#160; The spell broke.</p>\n<p>Someone cried out.</p>\n<p>It had started.</p>\n<p>The outcry was picked up by others.&#160; People grabbed one another, arms were thrown around necks, fingers dug into costumes and skin.&#160; They whimpered, screamed, shouted.&#160; I could see tears in eyes, faces contorted in emotion.&#160; Groups turned inward, focusing on one another, loners backed away, positioning themselves where they had space to maneuver.&#160; Madness, hysterical, chaotic.&#160; Grown adult and child alike, costumed and uncostumed, individuals dressed in white or in bright colors, individuals in black, they were part of the riot.</p>\n<p>They held nothing back, emotionally.&#160; I saw fireballs explode in midair.&#160; People streaked into the sky, lightshows following after them.</p>\n<p>But the yelling, the echoes of that first cry, they were what shook me, what shook <em>everything</em>.&#160; The only thing around us to block the sounds were people, and those people were making <em>more</em> sound.&#160; Thousands echoing of that one cry.</p>\n<p>None of this surprised me, that they&#8217;d turn on each other the moment the real threat was gone.&#160; It was the way our species operated.&#160; A reality that had been writ over and over again in my experiences.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t remember the specific cases, but the lessons remained with me.</p>\n<p>I was standing, already, making my way to my feet with the help of the clairvoyant, with the device on my back, the attached arms.</p>\n<p>Easier to move when there was something to do.&#160; Fighting, fighting <em>back</em>.</p>\n<p>My movement had drawn attention.&#160; I started to draw my knife, and something stopped me, keeping it in its sheath.&#160; I abandoned it, turning instead to my swarm.&#160; They shifted positions, ready to use powers, to protect me against outside threats, and my bugs filled the spaces between them.&#160; The strangers around me responded in kind, preparing for a fight.&#160; Thirty, fifty people, waiting for me to act.&#160; More lurked in the fringes, ready to step in.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t an unfamiliar experience, to be surrounded in chaos, to be arrayed against impossible odds.&#160; For what I was now, for what <em>remained</em>, it felt only natural.&#160; All of this was as I&#8217;d expected.</p>\n<p>They were talking, exchanging hurried words, questions.&#160; Trying to cobble together a strategy.&#160; I had no such need.&#160; <em>My</em> side didn&#8217;t need to communicate.&#160; They were perfectly coordinated.</p>\n<p>Everyone here was a potential enemy, and I&#8217;d treat them appropriately.&#160; I just needed to focus, to get my bearings, and identify the biggest threats to me.&#160; If I eliminated or captured them, I could systematically kill everyone present.</p>\n<p>It was&#8230; not a calming idea.&#160; But it reassured.</p>\n<p>I was just a little unhinged, my perceptions were broken.&#160; I knew that.&#160; But if I had to live like this <em>forever</em>, if everyone was a threat for the rest of my life, I&#8217;d well and truly lose it.&#160; Stopping them, eliminating them and bringing them under my control&#8230;</p>\n<p>The only way we&#8217;d all achieve anything resembling <em>peace</em>.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d wanted peace for a very, <em>very</em> long time now.</p>\n<p>After everything I&#8217;d given up, I deserved peace.</p>\n<p>Someone was pushing their way through the crowd around me.&#160; I tensed.&#160; My hand went to my knife again, and again it was stopped.</p>\n<p>I heard the voice in my ear.&#160; It was <em>trying </em> to sound soothing, gentle, but it was failing.&#160; I heard the fear in it.&#160; That fear was reassuring in its own way.&#160; It told me I was right.&#160; That the world <em>did</em> revolve around fear and violence. That I was doing the right thing, standing guard, being ready for a fight at any moment.</p>\n<p>The madness around me continued unabated, the shouting fading, then starting anew, picked up by others, different factions, fresh sets of lungs.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to listen to the voice. Not with all of the powers arrayed against me.&#160; it would be idiotic and foolish if I did listen, whether I understood or not.</p>\n<p>The others, they were arguing amongst themselves, barking out insults, yelling, pointing at me.&#160; I&#8217;d taken control of them, and that was a <em>fresh</em> wound.</p>\n<p>The individual reached the edge of the crowd.&#160; A man, bearded, with a small entourage of people wearing white.</p>\n<p>When he spoke, his voice was soothing, a constant stream of words, more like he was talking to a wounded animal than a person.&#160; He stopped at the circle&#8217;s edge, and I could see how many of the others were tense, wary.</p>\n<p>They recognized him, and they didn&#8217;t like him.</p>\n<p>If I was going to exterminate them all, then I could use the fact that they weren&#8217;t all friends.&#160; Let them fight each other, wear each other down&#8230;</p>\n<p>Except I had <em>this</em> to focus on first.</p>\n<p>He was gesturing at his mouth, moving his hand as he talked.&#160; he pointed to me, then to one of his underlings.&#160; He repeated the three gestures, speech, me, underling.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t stupid.&#160; I grasped his meaning.&#160; I could see others around the circle relaxing.</p>\n<p>But they weren&#8217;t relaxing <em>entirely</em>.&#160; But they were relaxing, tension leaving their shoulders and hands.&#160; Weapons, poised at the ready, dropped a fraction.</p>\n<p>He was saying he had a means of communicating with me?&#160; But it, or <em>he, </em>couldn&#8217;t be trusted a hundred percent, judging by my own gut and the reactions of the others.</p>\n<p>He sent one of his underlings into my reach.&#160; A boy with a shaved head and thick eyebrows.</p>\n<p>I felt the underling&#8217;s body and powers unfold before me, and I could tell right away that there was something wrong.</p>\n<p>My eyes told me one thing, my power told me another.</p>\n<p>My eyes told me the man was just beyond the reach of my power, the boy following his orders.</p>\n<p>My <em>power</em> told me that whatever the boy looked like, he was a half-foot taller, he had a beard, and he was loaded down with trinkets and tidbits.&#160; I recognized him by his power.&#160; He made thinkers and tinkers, granted powers.</p>\n<p>He had three more, hanging back, watching.&#160; No doubt to help facilitate this ruse, whatever it was.&#160; To watch for people who could see through it, to watch his back.</p>\n<p>He was putting himself in my power.&#160; Whatever he&#8217;d had his other self, his disguised underling or his clone say, he was making his offer plain and clear to me.&#160; He&#8217;d let me use his power on myself.</p>\n<p>A chance to communicate, to fix something.</p>\n<p>I sensed my bugs moving, shifting position without even moving a limb or wing.&#160; Before I even grasped what was happening, I was moving.&#160; I cut out with my knife, feeling like I was swinging madly into open air.</p>\n<p>A girl materialized, shouting or saying something.&#160; She&#8217;d appeared just a little in front of me, her back initially to me as I continued cutting, the actions jerky and stiff, uncoordinated and continuing long past the moment there was any point.&#160; I could feel her body appear in my mind&#8217;s eye, and I asserted control over her.</p>\n<p>At my command, her hand moved up to her mask, raising it enough that she could press her own knife&#8217;s point to the roof of her mouth.&#160; One good <em>push</em>, suppressing reflexes, and she&#8217;d impale her brain.&#160; It was a good place to keep her, keeping any of her allies at bay.</p>\n<p>I was left panting, my knife-hand trembling.&#160; Someone had moved to get a bead on me with their gun, but boys in white had intervened to block the shot with their bodies.&#160; The girl&#8230; she&#8217;d been materializing, been making herself known, and I&#8217;d caught on a second before anyone else had become aware.</p>\n<p>The man had stopped in his tracks in front of me.&#160; Still in my control.</p>\n<p>Was it a trap?&#160; Probably.&#160; People didn&#8217;t like being controlled.&#160; He&#8217;d have measures in place.&#160; Maybe his underlings, maybe a device he wore.</p>\n<p>Was the offer still tempting?&#160; Yes.</p>\n<p>I had him extend his hands, offering them to me.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there was a need for making a <em>point</em>.&#160; He wanted to <em>manipulate</em> me?&#160; He could <em>bleed</em>.</p>\n<p>I cut.</p>\n<p>The blade of my knife found the flesh of his palms twice in quick succession.&#160; The slashes were as wild and frenzied as before.&#160; My <em>aim</em> was good, but my control wasn&#8217;t.&#160; A cut found the back of his forearm, tore deep through cloth, skin and muscle.</p>\n<p>My next cut was comparatively feeble, though it hardly mattered.&#160; A barrier appeared, a crystalline wall, and the knife bounced off.</p>\n<p>All around me, people reacted.&#160; My swarm shifted position, and were summarily buried in prisms of that same transparent, floating crystal.</p>\n<p>I had that one member of my swarm start singing again and she was shot an instant later, electricity arcing around her armor as she collapsed, unconscious.</p>\n<p>I had my <em>bugs</em>, but-</p>\n<p>I stopped.&#160; The reactions, the calls of alarm and the occasional shriek, they extended beyond the ring of people that surrounded me.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t right.&#160; The chaos beyond this one group, it should have left people blind to what was going on <em>here</em>.&#160; They shouldn&#8217;t have been able to turn their backs on the others.</p>\n<p>I was- it was <em>parsing</em> wrong.&#160; Didn&#8217;t connect.</p>\n<p>In that riot, that mob, there was no blood.&#160; The girl I&#8217;d cut wasn&#8217;t bleeding, the people in the crowd weren&#8217;t dying&#8230; only the hands and arm, held out for the knife to slash, were weeping with blood, only the older injuries, from a short time ago.</p>\n<p>People wrapped their arms around one another, but bones weren&#8217;t broken, limbs weren&#8217;t disjointed.&#160; The shouting and screaming wasn&#8217;t directed at anyone in particular, nor were the powers that were actively being thrown around.&#160; There were tears, but those same people were <em>smiling</em>.</p>\n<p>I hadn&#8217;t counted on having to deal with this many people.</p>\n<p>Too many with powers I wasn&#8217;t familiar with.&#160; The ones closest to me?&#160; The ones I&#8217;d just been controlling?&#160; I had a grip on them.&#160; But the mob beyond was something else.</p>\n<p>I felt a moment of trepidation.</p>\n<p>My senses&#8230; I was more disabled than I&#8217;d thought.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t make sense of what was going on beyond my swarm, could barely make sense of what was happening <em>here</em>.</p>\n<p>I moved, relying on two individuals to support me where my one leg wasn&#8217;t working properly.&#160; Not that the other was in great shape.&#160; Two individuals, the clairvoyant walking behind, hand strapped to my shoulder-</p>\n<p>I saw the forcefield woman in the crowd.&#160; Taller than most, a curved, crystalline horn on her forehead.</p>\n<p>The people surrounding my swarm were working to get back as I approached, but the press of bodies only had a limited amount of give.</p>\n<p>A forcefield materialized just in front of me as my power reached the very front of the crowd.&#160; I turned the newest additions to my swarm around, focusing them on the people who were looking to stop me.</p>\n<p>My bugs got in her eyes, blocking her sight, crawled into her ears.</p>\n<p>I felt as she bisected them with forcefields.&#160;&#160; I was already using the device on my back to move <em>over</em> the forcefield, getting a boost from the two who&#8217;d been supporting me to heave the clairvoyant up with me.</p>\n<p>He came down on top of me, and we landed hard, but we landed on the opposite side of the forcefield.&#160; Close enough, taking advantage of the woman&#8217;s momentary blindness.</p>\n<p>I lowered forcefields and set them in circles around me before pushing <em>out</em>.&#160; Separating the crowd to give myself room to maneuver.</p>\n<p>I needed to escape, I needed time and resources to analyze what I was up against, frame it all.&#160; I&#8217;d stabilized, I&#8217;d stopped degrading, now I could start building- <em>rebuilding </em>my knowledge base.&#160; Put everything into a context that I could grasp, with my mind working in a different way, with different priorities.</p>\n<p><em>Then</em> I could take control.&#160; <em>Then</em> I could eliminate the problematic elements.</p>\n<p><em>Then</em> everything would be peaceful.</p>\n<p>A mission.&#160; I functioned best with a mission.&#160; My thoughts and actions had always processed best when I had a mission, a <em>task</em>.</p>\n<p>I moved my swarm.&#160; Half of the original sixteen, they&#8217;d serve as bodyguards, protection, <em>tools</em>&#8230;</p>\n<p>I saw faces in the crowd.&#160; Young women riding a monster, blocking my path.&#160; More than any of the others, they were <em>strangers</em> in the manner I&#8217;d identified the rest of the crowd before.&#160; People I had some connection to, all the more <em>strange</em> because of the lack of recognition.</p>\n<p>People kept getting in my <em>fucking</em> way.</p>\n<p>I could have gone through, but I felt a moment&#8217;s trepidation.&#160; The strangeness, the strength of the connection.&#160; They were enemies, friends, <em>something</em>, but they held an importance.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t trivialize that.&#160; Couldn&#8217;t dismiss them.&#160; If they were that important, they couldn&#8217;t be <em>weak, </em>and that meant they were potential threats.</p>\n<p>She had a hand extended.&#160; Something dangled from one hand.&#160; A short chain, a black tube with a red button.</p>\n<p>That trepidation got worse.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t put my finger on <em>why</em>.</p>\n<p>The uneasiness reached a peak.&#160; I gave them one final look, watching for any trouble, then took to the air, crouching on a forcefield.&#160; The members of my swarm followed, flying around any barriers I erected.&#160; A man in blue and white who zig-zagged around anything I put up.&#160; A regal woman in blue.</p>\n<p>Too many unknowns.</p>\n<p>I changed my course, and I saw the woman with countless wings standing, the wings spreading, a weapon at her side.</p>\n<p>My pursuers were backing off, keeping a certain distance or circling around, giving her a wide berth.&#160; Was this a way through?&#160; If I leveraged enough strength, could I force my way past her?</p>\n<p>I was scared, but it wasn&#8217;t the usual kind of fear.&#160; Almost the opposite.&#160; I was used to being able to hold things together, with only the outward signs.&#160; To channel fear into concrete <em>purpose</em>.&#160; This was different, the outward signs limited at best, the underlying fear simultaneously affecting me <em>more</em>.&#160; Like so many things, it felt alien, like I wasn&#8217;t certain of what I was doing, and it threatened to throw me off course.</p>\n<p>That fear reached a crescendo as I closed the distance.</p>\n<p>She aimed the little gun, and I changed course at the last second.</p>\n<p>There was a small army after me now.&#160; Some were in the lead, and I made a point of blocking them, stalling with forcefields and directing ranged fire their way.&#160; The man in blue and white was chief among them, as was the blue woman in a regal costume.</p>\n<p>More were moving to follow.&#160; Enemies from every corner.</p>\n<p>Not a surprise.&#160; To be expected.</p>\n<p>A man, flying with great skeletal bat wings, a kind of lace or filigree of bone stretched between segments, rose into the air to intercept me.</p>\n<p>No, to intercept a member of my <em>swarm</em>.</p>\n<p>My swarm worked to cut him off, but he was agile, persistent.&#160; As massive and bulky as those wings seemed, they shapeshifted in the process of each flap, the lattice of bone opening up to let air pass through, then closing when he wanted the air resistance to bear himself higher, or to one side.</p>\n<p>In the end, a forcefield appeared through one wing, and he dropped a solid thirty feet before he managed to catch himself.&#160; It gave me a window of opportunity.</p>\n<p>The path of least resistance&#8230;&#160; There was another space with only one person in the way.&#160; A gap in the defensive line.</p>\n<p>It was a young girl that was barring my path.&#160; Her blond hair stirred in the wind of this upper atmosphere, and her great green-black costume seemed more decorative than anything else, with ribbons and loops of cloth flowing in a manner that made her look like a living work of art.</p>\n<p>She wasn&#8217;t living art, though.&#160; As remote as my understanding of humans was, I could understand what her tears meant.&#160; There was no smile accompanying them.</p>\n<p>Others had stopped, a distance away.&#160; Not wanting to interfere, even afraid.</p>\n<p>She met my eyes, and there was something in her expression that I couldn&#8217;t quite place.</p>\n<p>The man in white and blue was calling out, not orders, but something in that vein.&#160; Urging.</p>\n<p>I looked at the blond girl, and I saw three shadows form around her.</p>\n<p>My own swarm gathered, rising behind me on the floating shards of crystal.&#160; Some crouching, some standing, others sitting with legs dangling, as they preferred, running on autopilot.</p>\n<p>She approached me, and I held her gaze.</p>\n<p>She passed into my range, and -again- I felt the connection deviate.&#160; I maintained my awareness of her and her spirits, but my control over her slipped to one of her shadows instead.&#160; A shadow of a robed man with a blindfold and nails through his hands, wrists and upper arms.</p>\n<p>The other two &#8211; I recognized their powers.&#160; A man with access to many powers at once, a fluctuating, flexible thing, and an thin, plain looking man with no costume, head hanging, with the power to make doorways.</p>\n<p>She closed the distance, and her hand touched my cheek.&#160; I flinched away.</p>\n<p>I had my knife.&#160; If I couldn&#8217;t control her-</p>\n<p>She bowed, stepping away.</p>\n<p>I felt a moment&#8217;s fear.&#160; Except &#8216;fear&#8217; was the wrong word.&#160; The symptoms were right, if muted, the shakiness, the feeling in my gut, my thoughts being more fractured, a touch of queasiness.&#160; But it didn&#8217;t fit the scene, this meeting.</p>\n<p>Why would I be afraid?</p>\n<p>No, it was something else, and I was realizing what it was.</p>\n<p>I was familiar with my power acting of its own volition.&#160; This was something in that vein.&#160; My power had a firmer grip on the whole of <em>me</em>, and other things were on shakier ground, acting the way they pleased.&#160; Feelings.&#160; My body.</p>\n<p>Passenger.</p>\n<p>No, why would it care about any of this?&#160; Why would it care about the winged woman?&#160; The two individuals who&#8217;d been riding the monster?</p>\n<p>But it was the closest feeling I could manage.</p>\n<p>She spoke, and I couldn&#8217;t understand the words.</p>\n<p>When she saw that, she smiled a little, glancing over my swarm.</p>\n<p>A doorway opened beside her.&#160; She floated away a touch, as if inviting me through.</p>\n<p>I hesitated, at first, because of suspicion.&#160; I had <em>worlds</em> filled with enemies, worlds I needed to bring under my thumb if I was going to be able to relax for even a moment.</p>\n<p>I forced the worries aside.</p>\n<p>I felt another stab of that not-fear sensation.&#160; That <em>balking</em> on the part of my passenger.</p>\n<p>The others around us were moving closer.&#160; There were angry shouts from some corners.&#160; There was a degree of attachment between some of them and my swarm.&#160; I raised forcefields.&#160; The man in white and blue promptly shattered them with a massive laser.</p>\n<p>We were left staring at one another.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t move forward, couldn&#8217;t move back.</p>\n<p>Contradictions, opposing forces.&#160; Some threatening me to stay, others threatening me <em>if I stayed.</em>&#160; Contradictions in equal measure inside me.&#160; That odd dissonance.</p>\n<p>I stared at the portal.&#160; A point of no return.&#160; I could pass through, and I&#8217;d be able to take steps to get control, to carry out my plan.</p>\n<p>-Again, that dissonance.</p>\n<p>It was uncomfortable, distracting.&#160; I wanted to be able to pursue my goals unmolested.</p>\n<p>I started to move towards the portal, and again I felt the trepidation, halting me, threatening to take my control altogether.</p>\n<p>I closed my eyes, and despite every instinct telling me to do the opposite, I relaxed.</p>\n<p>Forgetting about the mission, about the goal.</p>\n<p>I could feel the shakiness returning, the unsteadiness.</p>\n<p><em>W-wwha- ddo y-y-you wwwant</em>?</p>\n<p>My control was slipping, the others descending as the forcefields lost altitude.&#160; The forcefield woman nearly slipped out of my range altogether.</p>\n<p>I reasserted control.</p>\n<p>Again, I tried to let my passenger take control, to set things on autopilot.</p>\n<p><em>Again</em>, the others began to descend.&#160; This time, the forcefield woman remained where she was.</p>\n<p>I let things continue, watched as they drifted away, back to the ground.&#160; The others gathered around me, the man with the blue and white costume, the man with bone wings, they backed off a little.&#160; I could see the latent aggression dissipating.</p>\n<p>Some were still angry, still looking for revenge.&#160; The woman in blue seemed more angry than protective, furious at <em>me</em>, silent as she was.&#160; But she had less backup now.</p>\n<p>It was a good move, for the short term.&#160; A puzzling one, but a good move.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d have a harder time taking control of things in the long term, but I was okay with survival.</p>\n<p>I watched the individual members of the swarm touch ground.&#160; The girl with healing powers had been placed deliberately next to a living pool of flesh with multiple heads of golden hair.&#160; The healer&#8217;s hands were covering her face, but she didn&#8217;t step away.</p>\n<p>Her hands slowly lowered, and she laid her eyes on the monster, which was actively, ineffectually reaching out for her.</p>\n<p>Others were placed indiscriminately in the crowd below me.&#160; My swarm, returned to the place they came from.</p>\n<p>I turned to go, and there was far less resistance.</p>\n<p>The autopilot took control of the clairvoyant&#8217;s focus.&#160; It turned my attention to faces.&#160; A blond girl.&#160; A girl with brown-red hair.&#160; The girl with the horned mask that I&#8217;d attacked so ineffectually with the knife.</p>\n<p>Others.&#160; A red haired girl in another world, shouting to people as she ordered them through a building project, a girl who was standing outside in the rain, in another world, kids peering through the window behind her.</p>\n<p>Before it could go any further, I wrested control for myself.&#160; Easier.&#160; It was like it was weaker with every set of actions.</p>\n<p>I passed through the threshold.</p>\n<p>Again, that discomfort.</p>\n<p>This would be a learning process, adjusting, adapting.&#160; I was learning what it wanted.</p>\n<p>It kept wanting sacrifices in the short term.&#160; Responding to its desires had left me feeling more secure, made the ensuing resistance weaker.&#160; The implicit promise was that acquiescing would be rewarded with a surer footing.&#160; Footing that I could <em>use.</em>&#160; There were doors open to every world.&#160; If I could take time to heal, to build my strength.&#160; Eating well, resting&#8230; I could move on, carry out my plan.</p>\n<p>The question was whether the cost was too high.</p>\n<p>It was a gamble.&#160; I was risking myself, setting myself back.&#160; People would come after me.</p>\n<p>But it meant more control, and it all came down to control in the end.</p>\n<p>I let the clairvoyant step through the portal, onto the shard I&#8217;d just abandoned.&#160; The forcefield woman held on to him, steadying him.</p>\n<p>I broke contact.</p>\n<p>The last thing I saw before I passed out was the door closing.</p>\n<p style="text-align:center;">&#9632;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">I opened my eyes.&#160; The moon was too bright, the stars like little shards of glass piercing my eyes.&#160; When I sat up, I felt muscles in my neck, back and shoulders seizing up, cramping.&#160; The world swayed around me like I was on a boat, even though I was on a hill in the middle of a forest.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">I was hungry.&#160; It had been a day, maybe two.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">I heard the cocking of a gun.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">My eyes shut.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Long seconds passed.&#160; I took the time to get my bearings, to catch my breath and let the world stop rocking around me.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">When minutes had passed and things were bearable, I turned to give my attacker a sidelong glance.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Twenty feet away, sitting on a rock with a little messenger bag beside her, was a woman in a white dress shirt and suit pants.&#160; Her gun was in hand, a little revolver, resting on her knee, her suit jacket draped over that same knee.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Strangely, I felt none of that odd fear from my passenger.&#160; Just the opposite, if anything.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">The woman spoke.&#160; The words didn&#8217;t make sense, but I <em>understood</em> them<em>.&#160; </em></p>\n<p style="text-align:left;"><em></em>Where the words themselves were nonsensical, my brain tried to parse them anyways, and they found a degree of sense in my head.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;<em>You knew it would come to this.</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">I didn&#8217;t move, staring.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Speech.&#160; It affected me more than I wanted to admit, hearing it.&#160; Even if I grasped the meaning.&#160; Brought me back to myself, just a little.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;<em>You don&#8217;t remember me, but if you don&#8217;t look too hard, you&#8217;ll be able to tap into vague recollections of who and what I am.&#160; You should know I have you in checkmate.&#160; There are no loopholes, no tricks, no ways out.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">My eyes moved over the area.&#160; I did what she suggested, and I could pick up a general impression of our past encounters.&#160; We&#8217;d crossed paths before, and I&#8217;d lost absolutely.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">If we fought here, I&#8217;d lose again.&#160; Especially like this.&#160; I&#8217;d try something, she&#8217;d shoot.&#160; The bullet would kill me faster than my swarm would kill her.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">A feeling of <em>defeat</em> settled on my shoulders.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;<em>Water?</em>&#160; <em>If you speak, I&#8217;ll understand.</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">She reached into the bag and grabbed a thermos.&#160; She threw it, and the corner of it sank into the dirt between my knees.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">I drank greedily.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;<em>What you are, you know you can&#8217;t be allowed to carry on.&#160; You don&#8217;t quite remember, but you&#8217;ve dealt with some who were like you.&#160; The Echidna, the Faerie Queen.&#160; You saw the Ash Beast.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Hearing the two&#8230; first two names makes me feel&#8230; shadows of feelings.&#8221;&#160; Talking was hard.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;<em>I imagine so,</em>&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;<em>We walked very similar roads.&#160; We&#8217;ve done ugly things for a greater good.</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;You still-&#8221; I started.&#160; Then I shut my mouth.&#160; Why had I talked?&#160; I hadn&#8217;t meant to.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">She raised one eyebrow.&#160; I didn&#8217;t understand what the expression was meant to convey.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;<em>Go on</em>,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t-&#8221; I started.&#160; What had I been saying?</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Not me.&#160; The passenger.&#160; I had to relax.&#160; Allow myself to speak.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;You still do ug-ly things.&#160; I saw you with T-teacher.&#160; You work with him now.&#160; As before, still do now.&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;<em>I&#8217;m not so sure,</em>&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;<em>There&#8217;s less of a mission, now.&#160; I have no cause anymore, and I hope that means I don&#8217;t lose sight of the little things.</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">I didn&#8217;t have a response to that.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Instead, she volunteered a little more.&#160; &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;ll try to do some things without any help, in the future</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">I stared down at my knees.&#160; I was still sore from my unconscious posture on the hard ground.&#160; She was talking about the future, and I didn&#8217;t have one.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;<em>I keep on asking myself the same questions over and over again</em>,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;<em>Maybe you can answer.&#160; Was it worth it?</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">I stared down at my hand.&#160; It was shaking, but it wasn&#8217;t from fear.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;<em>Would you do it all over again?&#160; Knowing what you know now?&#160; Knowing that you end up here, at gunpoint?</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8230; know I&#8217;m supposed to say yes,&#8221; the words made their way past my lips.&#160; &#8220;But no.&#160; Some-somewhere along way, it became no.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Just about everyone comes to this crossroad,</em>&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;<em>Some get seventy years, some only get fifteen.&#160; Enough time to grow, to take stock of who you are.&#160; Enough time to do things you&#8217;ll regret when you run out of time.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t- don&#8217;t regret it.&#160; Was- had to.&#160; Saved lives.&#160; But I would do different, given a chance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She smiled, bobbing her head up and down a little.&#160; &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s always about the people, isn&#8217;t it?</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Protect some, pay less attention to others.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Her smile twisted.&#160; A little sad.&#160; &#8220;<em>Can&#8217;t bet on the wrong horse.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Not what I&#8217;d meant.&#160; &#8220;Giving too much power to wrong people.&#160; To bullies.&#160; With powers, bullies without.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She gave me a slightly surprised look at that.&#160; &#8220;<em>I don&#8217;t see that applying to Scion.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>He doesn&#8217;t factor?&#160; He isn&#8217;t a consideration, at the end</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fighting him&#8230; always more about <em>us</em> than about him.&#160; Not a consideration.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>And the person who played the biggest role in stopping him doesn&#8217;t give him a second thought,</em>&#8221; she said.&#160; There was a note of emotion in her voice.&#160; She was gripping the gun handle tightly enough that her knuckles turned white, but her expression wasn&#8217;t an angry one.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t respond.&#160; I felt like it might have been rude to.&#160; We all had our demons, our burdens, and this was hers.</p>\n<p>The silence yawned on.&#160; I took another gulp of water from the thermos, swallowing past a lump in my throat.</p>\n<p>I looked at the trees.&#160; I was reminded of&#8230; the scene was hard to reach.&#160; Of home, not long after it stopped being home.</p>\n<p>Was it the other way around?&#160; When I imagined that rotting, flooded city that smelled like garbage and seaweed, what was it to me?</p>\n<p>Or was it different things to the two biggest pieces of me?</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>They&#8217;re offering amnesty to all but a few</em>,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t surprised.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>The Faerie Queen was brought in.&#160; You should remember her.&#160; She&#8217;s the one who let you go.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8217; I said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>There were a lot of eyes on you two, at the end.&#160; It reflected well on her, that she got you to free the captives.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>She hadn&#8217;t, but I didn&#8217;t explain.&#160; This woman probably knew, anyways.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>She was questioned about you, in the hopes that the heroes could use the information to find you.&#160; I got the transcription of the interview,</em>&#8221; the woman in the suit said.&#160; She patted the bag.&#160; &#8220;<em>I could use my power to get the answer, but it&#8217;s been a long journey here, and we&#8217;re in no rush.&#160; Do you&#8230; does the word &#8216;anchor&#8217; mean anything to you?</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>It took me a second, but I nodded a little.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>What did you pick, in the end?</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>I opened my mouth to answer, but I found only blanks when I reached out.&#160; I closed my mouth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Ah</em>,&#8221; she said, as if that was answer enough.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A-ah?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>She went to great lengths to protect you,</em>&#8221; the woman said.&#160; &#8220;<em>She&#8217;s already on shaky ground, but&#8230; I think she saw herself in you.&#160; She held out hope that you&#8217;d found yourself.&#160; That she&#8217;d have a kindred spirit in you.&#160; It might even by why she balked at the end.&#160; Seeing you, realizing she&#8217;d built herself off of a lie, compromising too much with her agent.&#160; In that decisive moment, she did something honest.&#160; Maybe you inspired that.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Was I honest?</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Were you honest enough to inspire that?</em>&#8221; the woman asked, echoing my thoughts.&#160; &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s&#8230; probably the most important question I&#8217;m going to ask you tonight.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d started my career on a lie, an undercover operation.&#160; I&#8217;d ended it by betraying what I stood for.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>I think you have the capacity to answer,</em>&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;<em>You&#8217;re more lucid than you were.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Talking&#8230; talking helps.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>That&#8217;s part of why I&#8217;m asking, Taylor Hebert.&#160; Weaver, Skitter, Khepri, I&#8217;m thinking you&#8217;re not totally gone.&#160; Glaistig Uaine told you to hold on to an anchor.&#160; The other ones, the little ones?&#160; They might have gotten you through the events, given you the strength from moment to moment.&#160; But you had something bigger.&#160; Something more fundamental, which was there before the battle even began.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>I knew she was right, but-</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Were you really a monster in the end?&#160; A warlord, an alien administrator?&#160; A vicious killer with a cruel streak, mutilating your enemies and secretly enjoying it?&#160; A bully, if you forgive me for using that word?</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>I looked down at my hand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Or were you really a hero?&#160; Do the good intentions win out?&#160;</em> <em>Was it Glaistig Uaine&#8217;s strength or yours, that held her back from saving Scion in those final moments?</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why&#8230; does it matter?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Because I think you have a chance to come back from this.&#160; Not much of a chance.&#160; Part of that rides on me.&#160; I could help you, or I could stop you from troubling anyone ever again.&#160; Part of that?&#160; It&#8217;s up to you to win the fight, to take control and keep the administrator from claiming everything you have, leaving you a shell.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>I felt a chill.&#160; Was part of it my passenger?&#160; Both of us?</p>\n<p>I opened my mouth to reply, and I couldn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Didn&#8217;t deserve to, either way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>It&#8217;s okay.&#160; I got the answer, myself.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>I looked away.</p>\n<p>I looked <em>up</em>.&#160; My eyes were wet.</p>\n<p>So many stars.&#160; The universe so vast.</p>\n<p><em>We&#8217;re s- so very small, in the end.&#160; </em></p>\n<p>The first bullet hit me from behind, where my mask offered no coverage, and I slowly toppled.&#160; The second hit me before I could fall, before there could be any pain.</p>\n'<h1 id="chap7">Teneral e.1</h1>b'<p>&#8220;I expect I&#8217;m not doing myself any favors,&#8221; the girl spoke.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Favors?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Remaining silent.&#160; You&#8217;re here to judge me, and silence is damning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure I like the word &#8216;judge&#8217;.&#160; Evaluate is a better word.&#160; <em>Listen</em> is better still.&#160; I want to listen to you, because I can&#8217;t help you if I don&#8217;t understand you, and I want my understanding of you to come from <em>your</em> words,&#8221; Jessica Yamada spoke.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Silence says a great deal, does it not?&#160; I recently heard a man speak to the people in charge about the homeless, the masses of refugees we are still trying to find homes.&#160; He spoke of needs, of women and children, and of families that have been broken because temporary shelters don&#8217;t allow the men within.&#160; He proposed a plan, then justified it with a diatribe on humanity and pity, leadership and the threat of unrest, the threat of people manifesting powers, and he talked of faith.&#160; He finished on that note.&#160; Do you know what point the canniest people in the room are left paying attention to?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You were talking about silence.&#160; Something the man <em>didn&#8217;t</em> say.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You <em>are</em> paying attention,&#8221; the girl said, sounding mildly surprised.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my job.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re already aware that what one leaves out is as telling as what they include.&#160; The <em>void</em> in our speech, if you will.&#160; The gaps.&#160; The man said nothing of resources, of food supplies, because he does not want to raise the topic, and he has no answers there.&#160; Silence can be louder than words.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The therapist nodded.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s an interesting thought, and it&#8217;s one we could talk at length about, but, please excuse me for saying so, I think you&#8217;re dodging the question.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Dodging?</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Evading, avoiding-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was not asking for clarification, doctor.&#160; I was expressing <em>indignation,</em>&#8221; the girl said, stressing the last word.&#160; There was a kind of <em>vibration</em> in the words as she said it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Whatever else you are, you&#8217;re still human.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was a time I&#8217;d have swiftly responded to that,&#8221; the girl said.&#160; &#8220;You would be dead, if you were fortunate enough.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;And you&#8217;re acting like I should be able to read something in your silence.&#160; The problem is that speech needs periods of silence to be intelligible, to separate the words and keep it from being a steady drone of noise.&#160; To frame it.&#160; The opposite is true.&#160; To find the meaning in what&#8217;s left unsaid, we need words to punctuate it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The girl opposite Jessica Yamada frowned just a little.&#160; Her deep green eyes didn&#8217;t move a fraction as she met the therapist&#8217;s.&#160; It held an intensity that suggested she could have faced down a stampeding elephant or an airborne missile.&#160; Very reluctantly, she said, &#8220;&#8230;Fair.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The therapist relaxed a touch, sitting back in her chair.&#160; &#8220;What we do here is up to you.&#160; I&#8217;ve had patients who enjoy this kind of verbal jousting.&#160; Many walk into a first session with preconceived ideas, that they&#8217;ll be forced to lie on a couch and bare their vulnerabilities while I pry at them with questions.&#160; A debate gives them their power back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the approach that makes sense.&#160; The, er,&#8221; the girl stumbled uncharacteristically as she searched for a word, &#8220;<em>parahumans</em>&#8230; they tend towards conflict.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is a lot of evidence to suggest that&#8217;s the case.&#160; Do you?&#160; Tend towards conflict?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No.&#160; Which is a good thing, I imagine.&#160; My other half was always more patient, more relaxed than most.&#160; Its duty was always at the <em>end</em>.&#160; For those who had duties at the <em>beginning, </em>it would be harder.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;How do you define beginning and end, when it&#8217;s a cycle?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Beginnings and endings,&#8221; the girl mused.&#160; She smiled a little.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m tempted to say you just <em>know</em>.&#160; That it&#8217;s instinctual, you <em>know</em> what you are.&#160; But that&#8217;s something of a coward&#8217;s answer.&#160; More correct to say that you can distinguish the two when there&#8217;s a long, long journey in the middle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The therapist shifted her position, taking a glass of water from the table beside her and sipping it.</p>\n<p><em>No doubt inviting me to keep talking</em>, the girl thought.&#160; She turned her attention to her drink.&#160; It was cold.&#160; She exercised her power, reaching into the deep dark well within her, and withdrawing a single individual.</p>\n<p><em>P&#245;letama, the firesinger.<br>\n</em></p>\n<p>The individual emerged, coalescing from shadows.&#160; A woman, dark skinned, with skin painted in wild colors that had once hidden her features as well as any mask.&#160; Where it had once been paint and flesh, the barest minimum of cloth, the flesh ridged.&#160; Her eyes burned as she stared out from the shadows of her deep-set eyes.</p>\n<p>The girl didn&#8217;t take her eyes off the therapist as the firesinger reached out and put one glowing fingertip into the water.&#160; It took a moment for the liquid to start steaming.</p>\n<p>The other two shadows stood at different points in the room.&#160; One stared at the bookshelf, its lips moving as it murmured in a voice only the girl could understand.&#160; The other stood at the window, arms folded, his cape moving in a wind that wasn&#8217;t present, hood hiding his features.</p>\n<p>The girl in the heavy leather chair, by contrast, wore only a sleeveless top and a knee-length skirt.&#160; Both the collar of the top and the skirt had heavy lace at the edges.&#160; Her blonde hair was braided.&#160; It made her look far younger than she had in previous appearances, and she&#8217;d looked young then.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You were tempted to say you instinctually know who you are,&#8221; the therapist said.</p>\n<p>The girl tilted her head a fraction.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be blunt, I&#8217;d say the vast majority of my patients don&#8217;t know who they are.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The girl lifted the steaming mug to her lips.&#160; The smell of the heavily spiced mead flooded the room. The therapist didn&#8217;t comment, hadn&#8217;t commented.&#160; She was <em>technically</em> legal, however young she might look.</p>\n<p>The girl swallowed, then said, &#8220;<em>What</em>, not who.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same thing, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; the girl responded.</p>\n<p>The therapist spoke a little slower, as if she were testing her words in her head before she spoke.&#160; Exceedingly careful.&#160; &#8220;You seemed to know who or what you were, before, and you changed your mind.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;People are allowed to do that.&#160; To change.&#8221;&#160; The response was dismissive, cavalier.&#160; All such a statement demanded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Do you consider yourself <em>people</em>, then?&#160; Just a minute ago, you said you would have taken offense to the idea.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You harp on.&#160; These are all variations on the same question,&#8221; the girl said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; Who are you?&#160; How do you see yourself?&#160; Has that changed?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am very possibly the strongest being alive on this planet, short of the remaining Endbringers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Very possibly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A murderer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In what sense?&#8221; the therapist asked.&#160; &#8220;One who has murdered, or one who murders?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Same thing, isn&#8217;t it?&#160; You don&#8217;t leave that behind you.&#160; Nobody lets you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;People can forgive and forget.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;They might forget murder, they might forgive madness, but they won&#8217;t be so ready to make peace with a lunatic murderer,&#8221; the girl said.&#160; She sniffed a little, as if scoffing at the thought.&#160; &#8220;You wanted to know who I am?&#160; I was perhaps Scion&#8217;s greatest ally, until&#8230; I wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>\n<p>When the girl spoke, an echo had creeped into her voice.&#160; A chorus.&#160; &#8220;You know, I could kill everyone, if I so chose?&#160; If I decided to stand, right here and right now, and kill you all, it would be fully within my power?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The therapist didn&#8217;t flinch.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Do you doubt me?&#8221;&#160; The chorus was there in full.&#160; A hundred voices from one mouth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, I don&#8217;t know enough about the combat side of things to say,&#8221; Ms. Yamada said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cause for any sane person to worry for their welfare, and for the welfare of their loved ones.&#160; You pretend indifference.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m anything but indifferent.&#160; I&#8217;m genuinely more interested in the fact that you seem to be avoiding the subject.&#160; A subject <em>you</em> raised.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I grow irritated with this pedantry,&#8221; the girl said.&#160; She stood abruptly from the chair.&#160; Two of the shadows dissipated into smoke.</p>\n<p><em>Prolapse, torturer&#8217;s son.</em></p>\n<p><em>P&#772;h&#363;&#770; comt&#299;, rider in daylight.</em></p>\n<p>The two new shadows took their place on either side of her.&#160; Big individuals.&#160; Villains, once upon a time.</p>\n<p>The therapist continued, &#8220;You&#8217;ve stopped calling yourself the Faerie Queen.&#160; When I asked for a name, you stayed silent, and you sat there for nearly twenty minutes before talking.&#160; You could have helped Scion and destroyed us all <em>then</em>.&#160; You didn&#8217;t.&#160; I&#8217;m asking you what happened.&#160; It&#8217;s clearly important to you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes didn&#8217;t waver, but she lowered her chin a touch, and the angle of her head cast her features in deeper shadow.&#160; When she spoke, the choir of voices that came from her mouth was calm.&#160; &#8220;Do you have a preference, in how you&#8217;d like to die?&#160; I have a range of powers at my disposal.&#160; There are swift methods, but perhaps you&#8217;d like to go out more dramatically?&#160; If you beg for mercy, I could spare others.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re allowed to say you don&#8217;t<em> know&#160;</em>the answer, Ciara.&#160; If it comes down to that, then I can suggest an answer and we can explore it together.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The girl had gone still.&#160; Her shadows were flexing, one cracking knuckles on a hand roughly the size of the therapist&#8217;s entire upper body.</p>\n<p>The girl considered the visuals of crushing the therapist, the way flesh would pulp and seep between the shadow&#8217;s great fingers.&#160; It was a good alternative to dwelling on the feelings that had just stirred.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nobody has called me by that name in a very long time,&#8221; the words were more a threat than anything.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was in the records,&#8221;&#160; Ms. Yamada said, &#8220;I need to hear the answer from your lips first, before I can offer you my thoughts.&#160; But let me warn you, I&#8217;m only offering a suggestion. &#160;Food for thought.&#160; I read the transcripts from the debriefing you gave Chevalier.&#160; You talked about anchors.&#160; I don&#8217;t want you to&#8230; &#8216;anchor&#8217; to anything I say.&#160; Use it to find your own answer, instead.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You claim to know me better than I know myself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll discuss that point if and when we get that far.&#160; For now, I need to know <em>your</em> thoughts on what happened.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But please sit down, first,&#8221; the therapist said.&#160; &#8220;We both know you could kill me at any moment, here.&#160; Having <em>them</em> here doesn&#8217;t change that, but it&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It <em>is</em> admittedly vulgar,&#8221; the girl supplied.</p>\n<p>The therapist nodded.&#160; &#8220;We&#8217;ll go with that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The shadows dissipated.</p>\n<p><em>Ampelos, the ill-fated.&#160; I was the ill fate.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daimones, the lost.</em></p>\n<p>The ones who replaced them were children.&#160; One, young enough to be androgynous, wore a long-sleeved shirt that hung down to its knees.&#160; It spun in place, skipping, then spinning again, a toddler at play.&#160; The other explored the room.&#160; The man with the hood and cape remained by the window, arms folded, staring out at the world beyond.</p>\n<p>Ciara spoke.&#160; &#8220;He broke.&#160; He was strong, he was noble, proud.&#160; He was a monster, alien.&#160; They brought out the humanity in him, and then they broke him.&#160; I could have stepped in, but I didn&#8217;t.&#160; I don&#8217;t know why.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The words were a challenge more than an admission.&#160; A demand for a better answer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Would you like to hear my theory, then?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;As you wish,&#8221; Ciara replied.&#160; She didn&#8217;t quite manage to feign the indifference she was going for.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re exactly what you appear to be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What do I appear to be, doctor?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;An adolescent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ciara frowned.&#160; &#8220;I had hoped for a <em>good</em> answer.&#160; I&#8217;m older than&#160;<em>you</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Only just.&#160; Chronologically, I think we&#8217;re the same age, nine months apart.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You miss my point,&#8221; Ciara said, clearly annoyed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No.&#160; I got it.&#160; Chronologically, you&#8217;re older, and by those measures, your youth is only a mask you wear.&#160; By <em>other</em> measures, you&#8217;re still a child.&#160; You triggered at a very young age, you were no doubt isolated, as masters tend to be.&#160; No doubt surviving purely by your own methods.&#160; Somewhere along the way, something happened.&#160; You stole the wrong power, you fought someone and lost, or you found yourself in a bad situation.&#160; In the course of that event or in the wake of it, you unlocked stronger powers, and they eclipsed you as a person.&#160; Am I too far off track, here?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ciara didn&#8217;t respond.&#160; Her hard stare was a challenging one, now, a <em>hard </em>stare.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You were still a child, and you needed rules and a foundation to define yourself by, as any child does.&#160; Your chose your anchor, chose Scion, and you formed your view of capes as faerie to distance yourself from a world you barely felt in touch with.&#160; You built up your persona as Glaistig Uaine, a name others gave you.&#160; It might have even played a role in why you turned yourself in and took up residence in the Birdcage.&#160; You craved <em>structure</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re calling me a child?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <em>suggesting </em>you were functionally a child until a very short time ago.&#160; You&#8217;re now an adolescent.&#160; Scion was a powerful figure in your life, owing at least partially to your power&#8217;s involvement in your day to day, minute-to-minute existence.&#160; Virtually every child goes through a phase where their parents are invulnerable, incapable of failure, strong, and beautiful.&#160; They grow out of that phase when reality challenges that assumption.&#160; If what I&#8217;m suggesting was true, well, reality never challenged the assumption because it was <em>true</em>, in Scion&#8217;s case.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Up until the moment he began to lose,&#8221; Ciara said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many begin to rebel against their parental figures around the time they enter adolescence, around the time they start seeing their parent as flawed <em>humans</em>.&#160; In your case, it was a faster process.&#160; A moment&#8217;s decision.&#160; Whether I&#8217;m right or not, you were thrust into a new mode of thinking, a new mode of <em>being</em>, and it has to be bewildering.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Your theory, then, is that the most powerful cell block leader of the Birdcage was a mere <em>child, </em>however old she might have appeared?&#160; That the answer to my present crisis in identity is that I am a mere <em>teenager</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the adolescent, the greatest, most defining challenge is to find themselves.&#160; To seek out identity.&#160; For the unpowered youth, it&#8217;s often a question of what clique they fit in, what clothes they wear, how they express themselves, and what path they want to step forward on, in terms of possible careers.&#160; For powered youth, it&#8217;s about all of the things I just mentioned, as well as the villain and hero labels, their place on the team, their place in family, the bonds they form.&#160; These are questions you&#8217;re now asking yourself.&#160; Am I wrong?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I dislike being painted with such broad strokes, doctor,&#8221; Ciara spoke.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are <em>always </em>variations,&#8221; Ms. Yamada said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;d never approach a patient with the idea that it comes down to this and this alone.&#160; It&#8217;s a starting point.&#160; You need to find yourself, and you need to do it with the burdens of the strongest human being on the planet.&#160; I&#8217;m telling you, here and now, that this is something <em>everyone</em> faces at some juncture.&#160; It&#8217;s perfectly alright to define yourself as &#8216;someone who is looking for definition&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The girl smiled a little.&#160; She lifted her mug to her lips, then wiped her mouth with her thumb.</p>\n<p>The therapist took another drink of water.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;re smiling?&#160; I suppose I don&#8217;t need to worry about my impending death, then?&#8221;</p>\n<p>When Ciara spoke again, her voice was normal.&#160; &#8220;What you said is&#8230; a thought.&#160; I was smiling because I was wondering what your superiors would think if they knew what you&#8217;d told me.&#160; A powerful parahuman, free to <em>find</em> herself?&#160; Perhaps I&#8217;ll follow in the footsteps of my &#8216;parent&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any superiors,&#8221; the therapist said.&#160; &#8220;The PRT is done.&#160; There are groups trying to cobble together a replacement, but it&#8217;s looking shaky at best.&#160; I&#8217;m here because I was invited, and because I want to help people.&#160; I&#8217;d like to help <em>you</em>.&#160; I think everyone would be much happier if we found you a path that isn&#8217;t following in his footsteps.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Did I ask for your help?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still here,&#8221; Jessica Yamada said.&#160; &#8220;Y-&#8221;</p>\n<p>She didn&#8217;t get further.&#160; There was a knock on the door.</p>\n<p>The concern on the woman&#8217;s face, Ciara noted, was more than it had been when she&#8217;d been threatened with her own imminent death.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Please excuse me.&#8221;&#160; The woman stood from her chair and crossed the room.&#160; She opened the door.</p>\n<p>Ciara watched as the figure unfolded before her.&#160; A giant armored in the skin of a monster, a knight, a wisp of a figure, all at once.&#160; She could see his very <em>presence</em> tearing through the doorframe, the slightest movement tearing whole sections of the building to rubble.&#160; She could feel the vibrations, taste the dust in the air.</p>\n<p>But that was only one version of the building, out of sight, out of mind.</p>\n<p>As if she was squinting without moving her eyelids, she refined her vision, saw him as the therapist saw him.&#160; A man in gold and black armor.</p>\n<p>His voice was barely audible.&#160; &#8220;Ms. Yamada.&#160; I&#8217;m sorry to int-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a session, Chevalier.&#160; An <em>exceedingly</em> important session.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know.&#160; I&#8217;m really very sorry.&#160; I had a small opening in my schedule.&#160; I was hoping for just one minute to talk with you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <em>in a session</em>.&#160; You agreed to abide by any rules I set.&#160; This was a pretty big one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t talk to you now, I&#8217;d have to wait three days to get another chance.&#160; My hands are full.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can imagine.&#160; But I&#8217;m in a session.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;One minute.&#160; Trust me when I say I know how important it is that you stick to your rules.&#160; But this is important enough that I have to ask.&#160; Can I have one minute of your time?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The woman hesitated.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Please.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The therapist turned, meeting Ciara&#8217;s eyes.&#160; &#8220;No, Chevalier, I-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll manage on my own,&#8221; Ciara said.&#160; &#8220;In fact, I would appreciate having a minute or two in private to think over what we talked about earlier.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ms. Yamada frowned.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back shortly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The door closed.</p>\n<p><em>Roucouler</em>, <em>the Liar.</em></p>\n<p>The little girl that was exploring the room dissipated.&#160; A man appeared behind Ciara&#8217;s seat, his leering grin stretched into a caricature, a mockery of what he&#8217;d worn in life.&#160; His teeth had no divides between them, making them one bony shelf, and his eyes were stretched into slants by the too-wide grin.&#160; A cartoonish appearance.</p>\n<p>Roucouler leaned over the top of the chair, and she could hear his whispers, in a French accent.&#160; He pitched his voice to distinguish between the two.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>-cohol in there?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>She had her shadow make it for her.&#160; She&#8217;s not the type to get drunk, and it&#8217;s more of a comfort thing than anything else.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>A bear walks into your restaurant.&#160; What do you serve him?&#160; Anything he damn well wants.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>There is that.&#160; What do you want, Chevalier?&#160; This is nerve-wracking enough, without interruptions.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Did something happen?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>I can&#8217;t talk about my sessions with my patients.&#160; If we&#8217;re going to talk, let&#8217;s talk about your business.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>I&#8217;m running out of time.&#160; Three days from now is too long to wait, because things take time to set in motion.&#160; I&#8217;m going to have to start making decisions, about amnesty for everyone who participated in the fight, about the hero teams, how we&#8217;re going to administrate a city that has more sheer depth than anything we&#8217;ve ever conceived of.&#160; That woman, in there, she&#8217;s at the crux of this.&#160; Choices I make in regards to her affect everything else.&#160; If I forego amnesty for her, if I have to forego amnesty for her, then I&#8217;m drawing a line in the sand, and others are going to wonder if they fall too close to that line.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>I can&#8217;t tell you how the session is going, Chevalier.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>I hate that you even have to say that.&#160; I&#8217;m not going to ask you to violate any confidentiality.&#160; I&#8217;m saying I could really do with you making your evaluation and then sending her on her way.&#160; There&#8217;s apartments here, we can set her up very comfortably.&#160; As comfortably as a queen might want.&#160; If she needs further therapy, you can send her there.&#160; If she&#8217;s stable enough to discuss business, be it amnesty or something else entirely, you could send her to me.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>I understand what you&#8217;re saying.&#160; If she&#8217;s dangerous enough to warrant violating confidentiality, it doesn&#8217;t matter.&#160; If she isn&#8217;t, then I can let you know how the therapy went without explicitly telling you.&#160; I&#8217;m not entirely comfortable with this.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>There have been more overt communications on this front</em> <em>in other situations.&#160; Situations that weren&#8217;t so grave.&#160; We can&#8217;t afford not to know.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>I can&#8217;t afford to tell you, Chevalier.&#160; I just&#8230; let me think on it.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>That&#8217;s all I ask.&#160; We need help, Jessica.&#160; I know you can&#8217;t make a full judgement in three days, not with someone as&#8230; complex&#8230; as she is.&#160; But a starting point could make all the difference.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>I understand.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>We&#8217;re putting the pieces back together.&#160; The scale of it is the biggest issue.&#160; All these worlds.&#160; There&#8217;s room for people to start piecing their cultures and their cities back together, there&#8217;s wilderness.&#160; Everything old is still there.&#160; Sometimes multiplied many times over.&#160; But there&#8217;s a lot of new, with more every day.&#160; It&#8217;s all exaggerated.&#160; We don&#8217;t have clout, and there are a lot of powerful people throwing their weight around.&#160; Scary people.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Speaking of&#8230;</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Your patient, I&#8217;ve kept you too long.&#160; I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>No.&#160; I&#8217;m wondering about someone who was a patient some time ago.&#160; Can I ask about this &#8216;Khepri&#8217;?</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>You can ask, but you won&#8217;t like the answer.&#160; I wouldn&#8217;t want you to be distracted for the remainder of your session in there.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ciara heard the Liar sigh, mimicking the woman on the other side of the door.&#160; &#8220;<em>I&#8217;ll take your word on that.&#160; I should get back to Ciara.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Ciara?&#160; Her civilian name.&#160; I&#8217;m going to walk away feeling optimistic about that.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>My lips are sealed, Chevalier.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>There was no goodbye.&#160; The door handle moved, and the door swung open.&#160; Roucouler disappeared.</p>\n<p><em><em>Pime</em> Abtiss, mother</em> <em>of the blind.</em></p>\n<p>Another shadow appeared as the therapist entered the room.&#160; A blindfolded woman with a small, deformed baby in her arms, umbilical cord stretching into a gap in the robe.</p>\n<p>Ciara could see a glimpse of the giant in the hallway, retreating, before the door shut.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry.&#160; That took longer than I expected,&#8221; Ms. Yamada said, as she took her seat.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; Ciara said.&#160; She ran her hand over the baby&#8217;s misshapen head.&#160; It dissipated into shadow, along with <em>Pime Abtiss</em>.&#160; She didn&#8217;t replace it with another shadow.&#160; &#8220;Forgive me, I overheard.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The therapist reacted a little to that.&#160; There was a moment&#8217;s pause, as if she was recalling everything that was said, searching for any damning detail.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll spare you the dilemma, doctor.&#160; When we are done, tell me where I should go.&#160; I relieve you of any confidentiality, tell the Destroyer what you must.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what we should aim for,&#8221; the therapist said.&#160; &#8220;If we go with my theory from before, then you&#8217;ve only just started making strides on your own.&#160; You&#8217;re growing up, belatedly, and you need to start making choices for yourself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d let me choose?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think a better place to start would be figuring out who you want to be.&#160; That <em>equips</em> you to choose, if you feel you&#8217;re ready.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And what if I were to say you&#8217;re being <em>presumptuous</em>, that I don&#8217;t need your help?&#160; I know who I am?&#8221;&#160; There was a threatening note to the girl&#8217;s voice, a return of that echo.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then we can talk about something else.&#160; Or you can go, if that&#8217;s what you really want.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ciara didn&#8217;t move, and her shadows remained in place, poised like animals ready to pounce.</p>\n<p>While the girl remained still, the three shadows resumed their ordinary business.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s begin, then,&#8221; Ms. Yamada said.<em></em></p>\n<p style="text-align:center;">&#9632;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">The rooftop was lined with crenelations and a wrought metal railing in a metal darker and stronger than iron.&#160; Some capes rested in the spaces between the twists of metal, while others sat with their backs to the shorter wall beneath it.&#160; The crowd had gathered around.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">But the moment she relaxed, it became something else.&#160; Phantom images, a man on fire, a woman who stood half again as tall as others.&#160; Images like her own shadows, caricatures, exaggerations, powers manifested physical.&#160; Except these were undoubtedly <em>alive</em>.&#160; They shifted from moment to moment.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Legend?&#8221; the Destroyer- <em>Chevalier</em> spoke.&#160; His voice echoed, but despite the massive size of his one suit of armor, or the slight form of his other suit, mangling the body within, the three voices were the same, only coming from different places.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">A man who blazed with light stepped forward.&#160; He was a living bonfire, blue-white in color, with living etchings solid in the midst of it, white hot, a stylized mixture of flame and lightning in one shape, floating in the storm of energy.&#160; They marked the position of his head, of his chest, his hands and feet.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">When the Coruscant Knave spoke, though, his voice was normal.&#160; <em>Legend</em>, she reminded herself.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;I was there at the beginning.&#160; I suppose it&#8217;s fitting that I&#8217;m here at the end.&#160; Maybe not <em>right</em>, there&#8217;s a hell of a lot I&#8217;m sorry for, but it&#8217;s fitting.&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">He took a deep breath, the flame swelling.&#160; &#8220;They say a picture&#8217;s worth a thousand words.&#160; Let&#8217;s shorten this speech, then and take a second to <em>look</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">He gestured, and heads turned.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">New York, in the process of being rebuilt.&#160; Dust and ominous clouds were being held at bay by a thin forcefield, and the city stood in the center of a brilliant sunlight.&#160; Where glass had broken and where oils had risen to the tops of city streets, things almost glittered.&#160; A shining city.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">For every damaged area, there were people, fixing things, scavenging and hauling things away.&#160; Tents and tarps were erected, barriers raised.&#160; Already, buildings were going up where portals had been torn between realities.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Chevalier had called it a city with depth.&#160; It was true.&#160; Most cities existed on a two dimensional level, spreading along the four cardinal directions.&#160; Buildings extended above and below ground, but even the tallest building was but a fraction of a distance compared to the <em>breadth</em> of the city.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Here, in this city, one could travel to one area and make a turn into another world.&#160; There, they would find the fledgling beginnings of an expansion, sprawling from that central point.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">It was too much to manage.&#160; Even the smallest villains had elbow room to maneuver and manipulate.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been one to couch my words.&#160; I&#8217;m direct, like my lasers,&#8221; Legend said.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful and it&#8217;s frankly terrifying.&#160; The Endbringers are, we&#8217;re praying, dormant.&#160; The major players are busy recovering and rebuilding, giving us six straight months of <em>peace</em> for the first time in twenty years.&#160; If you count non-parahuman conflict on a global scale, well, I don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s been.&#160; It&#8217;s been a hell of a while, if ever.&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Ciara closed her eyes briefly.&#160; When she reopened them, Legend was his human self.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Tiring, to maintain focus.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;The peace will end.&#160; It always ends.&#160; When things go bad, it&#8217;ll be worse because we&#8217;ve had the break, because it&#8217;s had time to <em>stew</em>, and because we&#8217;re still reeling from last time.&#160; But I know you, I&#8217;ve fought alongside a number of you.&#160; The badges you wear are signs of that.&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Ciara glanced around.&#160; Like her, many of the capes wore a simple symbol on their upper arms, a golden circle with a golden dot in the middle.&#160; For some, it was a loop of cloth, for others, it was engraved on armor.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">A simple symbol testifying that they&#8217;d <em>been there</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no more oversight, for better or for worse.&#160; That means it&#8217;s our job to keep our eyes open, to watch each other&#8217;s backs, and to watch each other.&#160; I can tell you right now it&#8217;s not going to be perfect.&#160; Maybe I&#8217;m a living reminder of the fact that we can&#8217;t trust anyone.&#160; For those of you who were paying attention, the circumstances of Alexandria&#8217;s demise in Brockton Bay are a testament to what happens when the corruption runs too deep.&#160; Nobody benefits.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Legend sighed.&#160; &#8220;Some are still angry at me.&#160; At Alexandria, Eidolon, and others, who played parts.&#160; But you haven&#8217;t spoken up, you haven&#8217;t interrupted me.&#160; I&#8217;d like to think it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re all recognizing the same fact.&#160; This?&#160; It&#8217;s our second chance.&#160; Something we&#8217;ve all dreamed about from time to time.&#160; A chance to cut out the rot and start anew, to fix things that were broken before.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There were one or two nods around the group.&#8221;And it&#8217;s going to be&#160;<em>hard</em>,&#8221; Legend said.&#160; &#8220;Those who know how badly we fucked it up on the last try, who know the full story, they get why this is so frightening a prospect.&#160; We still have to clean up the messes from last time, and we have to be doubly, <em>triply</em> sure we move ahead properly this time.&#160; Already, there are people plotting to take advantage of present circumstances.&#160; Already, there are things going wrong.&#160; It&#8217;s an uphill battle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Chevalier cut in, &#8220;Like those badges we wear show, we&#8217;ve all fought in at least one <em>bitch</em> of a battle, and we came out ahead.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be damned if we&#8217;re not ready for this one,&#8221; Legend agreed.</p>\n<p>Cheers rose from the group.&#160; Fists pumped in the air, boots stomped.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; Legend said, while the cheering was present but dying down, &#8220;With all that said, we&#8217;re moving forward with our second chances.&#160; I&#8217;d like to introduce you to the newest member of our Wardens.&#160; Valkyrie.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He gestured, and the crowd parted.&#160; All eyes fell on her.&#160; When she stepped forward, she had to be careful, her longer legs unfamiliar.&#160; Staying young had come with benefits.&#160; The Crone, <em>Schwarze Tante</em>, had been able to give Ciara some of the time she&#8217;d stored away.&#160; The ghost of a hero called Thane had fashioned her armor, shield and sickle.</p>\n<p>The crowd parted as she approached.</p>\n<p>The body of a nineteen year old was an unfamiliar one, the costume even more so.&#160; Gold and sky blue.&#160; The cloth that dangled from her belt traced the insides of her thighs to her knees, the skirt stopped mid-thigh, silent even with the gold chains that traced its edges.&#160; The mask didn&#8217;t block any of her vision, but it pressed against her cheekbones and forehead, reminding her of its presence.&#160; Even her hair was longer, tied back in a thick braid.</p>\n<p>She liked the wings, though.&#160; The wings were good.&#160; The rest would take getting used to, after thirty years as the childlike Faerie Queen, but the wings were a natural fit from the start.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve formed a new Triumvirate,&#8221; a cape in the crowd said.</p>\n<p>It might have sounded accusatory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Valkyrie will be starting on the bottom,&#8221; Legend said.&#160; &#8220;She&#8217;ll earn her way to whatever rank is most fitting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There were murmurs in the crowd.&#160; For many, the sentiment was the same.&#160; <em>I think we know what rank that will be</em>.</p>\n<p>For every two people that thought the strength she brought to the table was a good thing, there was one who was suspicious, doubting, or discouraged. They knew who she was.&#160; The figures that accompanied her made it clear enough.&#160; She couldn&#8217;t think of them as shadows anymore.</p>\n<p>She liked debating <em>words</em>, the power of words, of titles.&#160; It had been her favorite part of the sessions with the therapist.&#160; The subject of renaming them had come up in the recent past, along with the discussion of what her new identity meant, and her new name.</p>\n<p>Valkyrie, warrior women who guided the souls of dead warriors to the afterlife.&#160; These spirits were her warriors, not mere shadows.</p>\n<p>No, perhaps two people in her camp to one person against was optimistic.&#160; There were others harboring doubts, a little slower to offer their congratulations.&#160; Given time and a night to think about it, they would start to think about what her presence meant, that they might fall in battle and that she would claim them for herself, adding to her own power.</p>\n<p>Her vision flashed.&#160; For a moment, she might as well have been in hell.&#160; The capes here on the rooftop were inhuman, even monstrous, distorted and exaggerated.&#160; The city glowed with the distant presence of other capes, as though it were on fire.</p>\n<p>Valkyrie resisted the urge to pinch the bridge of her nose or shake her head.&#160; Her heart pounded long after the image had faded.</p>\n<p>Nobody had said this would be easy.&#160; Just the opposite.</p>\n<p>The speech was done, and the city around them demanded attention.&#160; Slowly, capes began peeling away from the group.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hey, Valkyrie?&#8221; Miss Militia asked.</p>\n<p>Valkyrie turned her head.</p>\n<p>Miss Militia jerked one thumb in the direction of a man with a massive round shield and spear.&#160; &#8220;Want to join us for a meal?&#160; We&#8217;re leaving on patrol soon, so we were going to grab an early dinner.&#160; You&#8217;re welcome to come with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Valkyrie opened her mouth to speak, then thought twice about it.</p>\n<p>She was still learning to talk <em>normally</em>, to stop affecting the faerie noble&#8217;s manner of speech.&#160; She was getting lessons, and it wasn&#8217;t perfect yet.&#160; If she spoke, it would turn heads.</p>\n<p>Except here, now, she almost missed the familiarity of it.&#160; The power of her old voice.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No obligation,&#8221; Miss Militia said.&#160; &#8220;Honest.&#160; I get it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Miss Militia had been the one to invite Ms. Yamada in, to connect them, and give her a chance.&#160; She knew, perhaps better than Chevalier or Legend.</p>\n<p>Valkyrie offered her a tight smile, then turned to leave.</p>\n<p>When she walked down the hall, flanked by her three chosen warriors, her heels struck the floor.&#160; There were Wardens in the hall, talking.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Defiant?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Complete radio silence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She was half again as tall as she had been, fit, glittering in armor, carrying a weapon and shield, and she felt more <em>fragile </em>than she had in a long time.</p>\n<p>Incomplete.</p>\n<p>Her vision flickered again, like lightning before a crash of thunder.</p>\n<p>As the Faerie Queen, she&#8217;d had a mission.&#160; She&#8217;d been a part of something vast, a powerful engine that had reshaped whole civilizations, then erased worlds from the universe.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got muscle now.&#160; Might be we can make headway.&#160; Retake the Eastern Queens portal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shh.&#8221;&#160; Eyes turned towards her.&#160; They talked about her like she was a secret.</p>\n<p>Too many people.&#160; She needed to talk to the therapist, but Ms. Yamada wasn&#8217;t here.&#160; She&#8217;d come at a moment&#8217;s notice, with only one phone call, but it somehow felt like that would only compound the feeling of fragility.</p>\n<p><em>I wanted to be more human</em>.</p>\n<p>Never <em>human</em>, per se.&#160; Only <em>more</em> human.&#160; Parahuman, instead of inhuman.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;d spent so much time in therapy, figuring out what Scion had been to her, coming to terms with the loss of the pillar he&#8217;d become in her psyche.</p>\n<p>In trying to distance herself from him, had she set herself on the exact same path?</p>\n<p>Seeing the flickers in the crowd wasn&#8217;t helping.&#160; She avoided them, making her way downstairs, into an adjoining structure.&#160; Once upon a time, she&#8217;d used that other sight exclusively.&#160; In this, in the here and now, she was warring with the keeper of the dead.&#160; A part of why she felt incomplete, fragile.&#160; They craved purpose.&#160; It took a special kind of willpower to avoid using abilities altogether.&#160; Some did, but they were rare.</p>\n<p>Using her power meant killing, it meant being around the dead, immersing herself in the gravest kinds of conflict.</p>\n<p>Would her experiment in humanity be so short lived?</p>\n<p>She found an empty hallway and took it.&#160; Things were under construction here, hidden behind plastic.&#160; She ignored it, taking the paths that were available to her.</p>\n<p>Finally, she came to a large room, a cafeteria, apparently, unfinished.&#160; Only half of the tables were present, the kitchen unoccupied and unstocked.&#160; The serving area had two tracks where trays could slide.&#160; One of the two racks was behind a thick plexiglass barrier.</p>\n<p>She sat down on a table, her feet on the bench, lost in thought.</p>\n<p>Not five seconds in, her official phone rang.</p>\n<p>She ignored it.&#160; <em>I only want some peace</em>.</p>\n<p>This wasn&#8217;t <em>her</em>.&#160; Had it been madness?&#160; Arrogance?&#160; Joining the side of the angels?</p>\n<p>Her vision was distorting.&#160; Even this far away from other parahumans, her other sight was showing their presence as a glow, as ripples.&#160; She turned her eyes skyward, but one figure streaked through the sky, well above her.</p>\n<p>She heard voices, and turned.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We meet again, Faerie Queen,&#8221; the voice echoed through the chamber.</p>\n<p>She turned to see a thin man accompanied by a brutish caveman of a figure, walking on the other side of the thick plexiglass.&#160; A child was on this side, petite, blonde, wearing a sweatshirt and jeans with pink sneakers.</p>\n<p>Valkyrie felt a pang of jealousy.&#160; She missed her old body, and the girl resembled her, superficially.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Goblin King,&#8221; Valkyrie responded. &#8220;I don&#8217;t go by that name anymore.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A pity, a pity.&#160; This is my Alice, visiting our not-so-wondrous Wonderland.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Riley,&#8221; the girl said.&#160; &#8220;I keep telling you, it&#8217;s not Alice, <em>Riley</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A mere title, not a name,&#8221; the man tittered some.&#160; It was an eerie sound, coming from someone his age and gender.&#160; Not that Valkyrie minded.&#160; She&#8217;d dealt with worse in the Birdcage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nevermind,&#8221; Riley said.&#160; &#8220;Alice it is.&#160; Whatev.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Valkyrie looked between the two.&#160; &#8220;Are you allowed to be here?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m incarcerated,&#8221; the Goblin King said.&#160; &#8220;She&#8217;s visiting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Officially visiting.&#160; They&#8217;re watching me.&#160; Probably watching you, too.&#160; We&#8217;ve played nice for the last stretch, and the illustrious Nilbog gets visits as a reward, so long as he&#8217;s good.&#160; We each keep our distance from the barrier, and they don&#8217;t use the cameras to fill us full of darts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Valkyrie followed the girl&#8217;s eye to a camera mounted in the corner.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As you can tell, I keep friends of the <em>highest</em> caliber,&#8221; Riley said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the man said, seeming very pleased with himself.&#160; The sarcasm appeared to be lost on him.&#160; &#8220;A fallen king is still a king, yes?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If he can hold his head high, then he&#8217;s more kingly than a man who relies on the crown and silks,&#8221; Valkyrie said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes!&#160; Yes!&#160; Quite right!&#8221; Nilbog agreed.</p>\n<p>Riley was smiling, as if despite herself.</p>\n<p>The phone was ringing again.&#160; Valkyrie canceled the call.&#160; She knew <em>why</em> they were calling, now.&#160; They were less than comfortable with this trio in one room together.</p>\n<p>No matter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I came for my weekly dose of sanity, if you know what I mean,&#8221; Riley said.&#160; &#8220;Spend enough time with <em>them</em>, you need a break from it all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I <em>do</em> believe I know what you mean,&#8221; Valkyrie said.&#160; <em>You mean just the opposite.&#160; A weekly dose of madness</em>.&#160; <em>A return to the familiar.&#160; </em>Both for comfort, and to serve as a reminder of how far they&#8217;d come.</p>\n<p>Dangerous, perhaps.&#160; She wondered if she&#8217;d share this with Ms. Yamada.</p>\n<p>Probably.&#160; People would pass on word.&#160; They were all being tracked, no doubt.</p>\n<p>But would she share what this <em>meant</em> to her?&#160; That she felt more secure than she had, leaving the rooftop meeting and speech?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shall we share stories of long ago?&#8221;&#160; Nilbog asked.&#160; &#8220;Of our kingdoms, as they were?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We could,&#8221; Valkyrie said.&#160; &#8220;Tragedies?&#160; Comedies?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In <em>my</em> stories,&#8221; Riley said, &#8220;The line between tragedy and comedy is awfully thin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I suspect my stories are mostly tragedies,&#8221; Valkyrie said.&#160; &#8220;Everyone worth talking about dies in the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just the opposite for me,&#8221; the Goblin King said.&#160; He ran one hand along the cheek of the neanderthal figure beside him.&#160; When he turned to face the barrier, he limped, and the brutish man helped him stay balanced.&#160; &#8220;My favorites persist, they keep coming back to start the adventure anew, a little different every time.&#160; This is my helper.&#160; They allow me him, only him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For a man talking about comedies, he looked sad.</p>\n<p><em>The amnesty still hasn&#8217;t gone through in entirety.&#160; There are snarls, like this king without a crown or a kingdom.</em></p>\n<p>There were distant running footsteps, growing in volume as they drew closer, suggesting that capes were en route to intercept her.</p>\n<p>Valkyrie glanced over her shoulder.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I suspect this visit will be cut short.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Fuck</em>,&#8221; Riley said.&#160; &#8220;Not that the goblin king isn&#8217;t awesome, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>She trailed off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maybe another time,&#8221; Valkyrie said.&#160; She raised her hands as the capes entered the room from the far corner.&#160; She had to pick her words carefully, so she wouldn&#8217;t sound strange.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m being good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d like to play it safe,&#8221; one of the capes said.&#160; &#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Another day, Faerie Queen,&#8221; Nilbog said.&#160; He smiled, bowing a little.</p>\n<p>Valkyrie returned the bow.&#160; When she rose to her full height, she was smiling a little in turn.&#160; It surprised her.</p>\n<p>Flip sides of the same coin.</p>\n<p>Rebirth.</p>\n<p>The act was an idle one, like one might move a hand inside a pocket to double check there was nothing inside it.&#160; She used her power.&#160; Bringing one of her warriors through, on the other side of the barrier.</p>\n<p>The neanderthal reacted.&#160; Valkyrie&#8217;s warrior didn&#8217;t manifest in full, but it flowed through the neanderthal&#8217;s body before rejecting the host.</p>\n<p>Almost.&#160; Close.</p>\n<p><em>Shepherd of the dead</em>, Valkyrie thought, as she walked away.&#160; The Goblin King was shushing his creation.</p>\n<p>They were all parts of a whole.&#160; The Chirurgeon, the Maker, the Keeper of the Dead.&#160; It only made sense that there would be synergies between such abilities.</p>\n<p>A way to bring her dead back, perhaps?</p>\n<p>She could see them, in the dark recesses, waiting, loyal, obedient.&#160; The ones she&#8217;d collected, some still mending from the great fight six months ago.</p>\n<p>She felt better now.&#160; Less incomplete.&#160; Her other half was content with this line of thinking.</p>\n<p>She just wasn&#8217;t sure where she&#8217;d take it.</p>\n'<h1 id="chap8">Teneral e.2</h1>b'<p>Nero leaned back in his chair, propping a boot on the edge of his desk.&#160; His lieutenants were bringing a line of prisoners into his &#8216;office&#8217;.</p>\n<p>They were treated to a view of a tall, muscular man, wearing armor on his legs, shoulders and arms, his chest and stomach bared, marked with small scars.&#160; His helmet had dark slits forming an &#8216;x&#8217; over each eye to allow him to see, and the metal came together in the middle to form an axe blade, extending from his chin to his forehead.&#160; His longer brown hair and beard were visible behind and below the edges of the mask.</p>\n<p>Braziers burned on either side of him, in the corners of the room, casting him in a flickering orange-red light while filling the room with a haze of smoke.&#160; Things had been expanding quickly enough that they couldn&#8217;t give <em>away</em> of all of the wood they were cutting down.&#160; Some wood was reduced to planks, while other trees were stripped of the exterior bark and branches and used wholesale, forming older-looking log buildings.&#160; Problem was, every tree that came down and every tree that was stripped meant huge amounts of debris.&#160; There were crews working on producing sawdust and chipboard, but even that was work intensive.&#160; Most went into the fires.</p>\n<p>This first winter would be the biggest test for the various settlements.&#160; Six months in, there were still far too many displaced people, and far too little in the way of shelter, despite wholesale efforts to put things in place.</p>\n<p>The prisoners, the <em>slaves</em>, finished filing in with their shuffling footsteps.&#160; Many looked at him, then looked away, spooked.&#160; More than a few were still in sleepwear, a couple were less than fully decent.&#160; They&#8217;d been dragged from their shelters and homes, forced to climb into trucks and shipped here.</p>\n<p>The resentment and fear was clear on their faces.</p>\n<p>He took his time looking them over.</p>\n<p>Lucan stepped up to the desk.&#160; &#8220;The product-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Is it urgent?&#160; Are people dying?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, but-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Are <em>we</em> going to die because of problems with the product?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No.&#160; People getting sick.&#160; It was cut with something ugly, we think.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That can wait.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lucan nodded, stepping back.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am not an especially cruel man,&#8221; Nero addressed the prisoners.</p>\n<p>They didn&#8217;t believe him.&#160; Nobody relaxed or even moved, at those words.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You work, you get your tokens,&#8221; Nero said.&#160; He opened a drawer, grabbed one pile of chains with attached tokens from inside, and then tossed the things onto the desk.&#160; They clattered, and one or two prisoners flinched.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is my system.&#160; We can&#8217;t police things every step of the way.&#160; Shelter, food, supplies, it slows things down, creates too much confusion.&#160;&#160;We use <em>these</em>.&#8221;&#160; He stabbed the pile of tokens with one finger. &#160;&#8220;So long as you have one, so long as you <em>earn</em> one, you can have what you need for the week.&#160; Food, water, and shelter.&#160; Get more tokens, you get access to more.&#160; Luxuries, comfort, a chance to voice concerns to me and my men.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He turned his gaze on each of the prisoners.&#160; &#8220;You took these things without a token in hand, which makes you thieves.&#160; If you had empty pockets when it came time to pay in a restaurant, they&#8217;d make you work as a dishwasher.&#160; I&#8217;m going to do the same.&#160; You&#8217;re getting punished, and then I&#8217;m giving you to Lucan there.&#160; He&#8217;ll work you for the week, keep you in chains and give you the bare minimum you need to get by.&#160; You&#8217;ll earn the tokens you pretended you had.&#160; Tokens you more or less stole from me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He gestured to his lieutenant with one gauntlet.&#160; Lucan held a shotgun, and one of his eyes was bloodshot, a perpetual beam of light extending from it.&#160; Lucan offered a sly smile.</p>\n<p>Still, the prisoners didn&#8217;t move.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you try to run, you won&#8217;t escape.&#160; One of the names they gave me was Persecutor.&#160; I was good at finding things and finding people <em>before</em> I got powers, and I got better after.&#160; If it gets to the point where you&#8217;re back here a second time and I recognize your face?&#160; It&#8217;ll get uglier.&#160; If you try to shirk your duties and leave, it&#8217;ll get uglier.&#160; You follow?&#8221;</p>\n<p>There were reluctant nods from the line of prisoners.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is the way things are,&#8221; Nero said.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;ve got guys like me in charge because you need us in charge.&#160; <em>Adapt.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Adapt?&#8221; one prisoner said.&#160; An old man, his hair sticking up from sleep and a lack of shampoo.&#160; He sounded just a little drunk.&#160; &#8220;Only reason you&#8217;re there and we&#8217;re <em>here</em> is you got powers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nero didn&#8217;t move.&#160; &#8220;Did you have tokens my lieutenants didn&#8217;t find?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No tags.&#160; I worked a full <em>nine</em> days, and they didn&#8217;t give me any tags.&#160; How am I supposed to work the next <em>seven</em>?&#8221; the older man retorted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t have three tokens, then you don&#8217;t have the right to look me in the eye and talk to me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then punish me, but I&#8217;m going to say what I want to say.&#160; You don&#8217;t <em>deserve </em>this.&#160; Being in charge.&#160; You&#8217;re causing more trouble than good.&#160; We were doing fine before you came.&#160; You&#8217;re a thug who got a lucky roll of the dice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nero shifted position, leaning forward, setting one armored elbow onto the desk.&#160; The posture helped to show the golden dot-within-a-circle emblem on his upper arm.&#160; &#8220;You don&#8217;t know what powers take from you, old man.&#160; What they cost us, the wars we&#8217;ve been in, the people we&#8217;ve all lost.&#160; Hell, you don&#8217;t know what it takes to get &#8217;em.&#160; So when you find that out, when you get your own powers, <em>enjoy</em> them for a bit, <em>then</em> you can talk to me.&#160; If you don&#8217;t get that far, you&#8217;d better learn to bow and scrape.&#160; I&#8217;m better than most, believe me.&#160; I&#8217;m actually <em>fair</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Your lieutenants demand two weeks of work for one week of sustenance.&#160; They demand sexual favors and help themselves to the things we managed to bring with us.&#160; <em>Precious</em> things.&#160; To me, that means you have to be a fucking idiot, running the day to day while they take advantage of you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Two teenagers in the group cast a worried glance in the man&#8217;s direction.&#160; Roughly the same age, seventeen or eighteen.&#160; Nero stared at them for long seconds as he considered the man&#8217;s words.&#160; He glanced at Lucan.</p>\n<p>Lucan shrugged.&#160; When the gunman looked towards the line of prisoners, the red laser that extended from one eye moved to suggestive places.&#160; The prisoners shifted uncomfortably.</p>\n<p>Hooligan, Nero&#8217;s self-imposed jester, entered the room with a canvas bag, open at the top and sides, wood scraps and sticks stacked within.&#160; He unloaded it in the brazier.&#160; Where snow lingered on the branches, the fire popped and steamed, adding to the heavy atmosphere in the room.&#160; He paused, glancing at the prisoners, then looked at Nero.</p>\n<p>Nero raised a hand, gesturing for Hooligan to stop.&#160; &#8220;Stay, Hooligan&#8221;</p>\n<p>He stood from his seat, crossing the room until he faced Lucan.&#160; He was three or four inches taller, which combined with his armor to make him rather intimidating.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; Lucan said, his voice a bit rough, &#8220;Man&#8217;s right.&#160; I&#8217;m milking you for everything you&#8217;re worth, Persecutor.&#160; Manipulating you left, right and center.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tragic, a travesty,&#8221; Nero said.&#160; Then he allowed himself a chuckle, looking at the prisoners, &#8220;We&#8217;re old friends.&#160; Next time, don&#8217;t go thinking you can turn people against one another, if they&#8217;re close enough to have matching codenames.&#160; Want to try anything else, old man?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The man didn&#8217;t show any disappointment.&#160; &#8220;Do your worst.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s not smart,&#8221; Nero said.&#160; He paused, as if suddenly restless.&#160; When he did finally speak, it was with a steadily rising volume.&#160; &#8220;Breaking my rules while living in my territory, you insult me to my face, and then you tell me to do my <em>worst</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The older man didn&#8217;t flinch.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Those two,&#8221; Nero said, pointing at the two teenagers who had reacted earlier.&#160; Nero didn&#8217;t take his eyes off the man.&#160; &#8220;They were with him?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the old man said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Lucan answered.&#160; &#8220;All squatting in one room.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nero nodded slowly.&#160; His fingertips drummed on the table.&#160; &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch the old man.&#160; Lock him up, but don&#8217;t touch him.&#160; His kids&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the man said.&#160; &#8220;No!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;They take it instead.&#160; Let&#8217;s leave no doubt they paid a price,&#8221; Nero said.&#160; &#8220;Shave their heads, then give them tattoos, nice and big, in a place where people can see.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He raised his hand, cupping it.&#160; A device, slowly rotating in midair, began to appear, slivers flying out of nowhere to fit in together like pieces from a puzzle.&#160; A long needle, a site for the ink to be plugged in, a handle&#8230;&#160; it was soon orbited by three vials.&#160; Rather than slivers, the liquid came in as round droplets, seeping into the vials to fill them before the splinters sealed the exterior.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Face?&#160; Neck?&#8221; Lucan asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; the man&#8217;s scream was ragged.</p>\n<p>Nero held out his hand, and Lucan took the device, holding out another hand to intercept the vials of colored ink as they completed one last rotation, slapping his palm.</p>\n<p>Nero approached the youths, taking hold of one&#8217;s chin and the other&#8217;s neck.&#160; Slivers appeared, converging on a point inside them, but when he pulled away, there was nothing visible.&#160; &#8220;Face or neck will do.&#160; Both, maybe.&#160; Something like &#8216;<em>property of Ner</em>o&#8217;, a drawing of my mask, or maybe a thank you to daddy, just to drive the point home,&#8221; Nero mused.&#160; &#8220;He <em>did</em> say I should do my worst, so be sure to give them a light beating, and&#8230; hm.&#160; We sell all the product already?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Still some left over,&#8221; Hooligan said.&#160; He was smiling, still holding the empty canvas bag.&#160; Enjoying the show.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then, as long as this merry band wants to take stuff for free, give this man&#8217;s son and daughter a share of the product.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No!&#160; No!&#160; Please!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nero stared at the screaming man.&#160; &#8220;By the time they go back to their daddy, I want them hooked enough they&#8217;ll <em>beg</em> to do my lieutenants favors or give my lieutenants anything of value they can think of.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The older man crumpled, doubling over, falling as much as he could fall with the chain stretching between his shackles and those of the people on either side of him.&#160; The pair of teenagers were cowering as Hooligan and Lucan approached, but the chain limited their ability to move to mere feet.</p>\n<p>The prisoners on either side stepped in, partially because of the pull on the chain, drawing them together, partially out of an instinctive need to provide some measure of protection to the vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Hooligan hopped up, flipping around until he was walking on the ceiling, then hopped down, landing behind the teenagers.&#160; Keys twirled around one finger.</p>\n<p>Hooligan began unshackling the pair.&#160; Lucan hit one of the people in the way with the butt of his shotgun, and the prisoners began backing away, stretching the chain taut once again.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Uncle!&#8221; the teenaged boy screamed.&#160; Panic was taking over, but Hooligan was stronger than he looked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The rest each get a light beating,&#8221; Nero said, &#8220;Nothing severe enough to keep them from working.&#160; Believe it or not, <em>uncle</em>, I&#8217;m trying to run this area.&#160; I&#8217;m not especially cruel.&#160; Not in relative terms.&#160; There are much worse people out there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The man looked shell shocked, caught between staring at Nero and watching the struggles of his niece and nephew as they were dragged into a back room by Hooligan.&#160; Lucan tossed Hooligan the tattoo gun and ink.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Uncle!&#8221; the boy screamed.</p>\n<p>The door slammed, and the uncle looked like he&#8217;d been physically struck by the slab of wood.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The rest of you, I know you don&#8217;t like me, and you <em>won&#8217;t</em>.&#160; But we&#8217;re going to make it through this winter, working hard even when it&#8217;s cold, we&#8217;re going to expand.&#160; If you don&#8217;t wind up leaving, I think you&#8217;ll see the fruits of what I&#8217;m doing here.&#160; We&#8217;ll be in better shape than other districts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They were listening, if only because it beat listening to the ongoing screaming in the other room.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Those other districts?&#160; I can tell you now, they have crowds of people in big empty buildings, shoulder to shoulder around fires, taking turns going out to get firewood.&#160; Getting cabin fever, whiling away the days, rationing food, trying to ignore the fact that some toddler or old person shit in a dark corner or pissed in their beds because they couldn&#8217;t be bothered to go <em>outside</em>.&#160; We&#8217;re <em>already</em> better off, understand?&#160; We can work through the season because I&#8217;ve got the tools, the warm clothes and everything else we need, and it&#8217;s going to keep us sane.&#160; And when winter passes and spring starts, we&#8217;ll be a step ahead, and you&#8217;ll be living in proper apartments, head and shoulders above the new people who are <em>clamoring</em> to live here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He turned his head as he looked over the group of prisoners.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;ll thank me.&#160; You won&#8217;t <em>want</em> to, won&#8217;t even want to think it, you won&#8217;t like me, but you&#8217;ll thank me for this, deep down inside, somewhere down the road.&#8221;</p>\n<p>No response, nothing.&#160; He had intimidated them into submission.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Take them, Lucan.&#160; Make it clear that their theft from this community won&#8217;t be tolerated, then get them settled in for the night.&#160; They start work tomorrow.&#160; We&#8217;ll talk about the product when you&#8217;ve got them settled.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lucan nodded.&#160; He gestured with the shotgun, and the line began moving, the empty shackles where the teenagers had been clattered.&#160; Some prisoners stepped forward to help get the older man to his feet.</p>\n<p>The group filed out.</p>\n<p>Nero waited until they were gone, then pulled his helmet off.&#160; He ran his hand through his hair, then scratched his beard.</p>\n<p>He made his way back to his desk, then sat down.</p>\n<p>The chair wasn&#8217;t in the position he&#8217;d expected it to be.&#160; He found himself falling.</p>\n<p>A chain went taut around the bare skin of his neck.&#160; He jerked to a stop, his rear end on the tilted chair, feet off the ground, his neck held up by the chain.</p>\n<p>When the momentary panic was gone, he reached for the edge of the desk.&#160; The chains of handcuffs clinked, pulling taut between his wrists and the armrests of the chair. The cuffs had been looped through a strap, rather than around the armor of his wrists.&#160; That didn&#8217;t make them much easier to remove.</p>\n<p>He raised his legs, pushing against the underside of the desk to relieve the pressure.&#160; He was allowed that much.&#160; If he pushed further, rocked himself forward&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Trust me on this, you want to stop struggling.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He froze.</p>\n<p>She sat on the desk, both hands on the other end of the chain.&#160; It looped up to the ceiling, through a hook, and down to his neck.&#160; She was the one holding him up.</p>\n<p>She tilted her head a little.&#160; She wore a mask with a reptilian smile, teeth extending past the &#8216;lips&#8217; at the corners, but the grin was barely visible with the heavy scarf that was piled around her shoulders.&#160; The mask had slanted eyes, black from corner to corner, and horns that curved over the top of her head.&#160; Her hair, in black cornrows, was free behind the mask.&#160; She wore a jacket and black cargo pants over a skintight outfit, all black.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Look down,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>He did, as much as he was able.</p>\n<p>There was a board resting on the ground.&#160; Nails and knives had been stuck through it, jagged, irregular.&#160; It was positioned so that if he fell, it would impale the back of his head and neck in fifteen or twenty different ways.</p>\n<p>He felt his blood run cold.&#160; If she found him too heavy, or if the chair legs slid&#8230;</p>\n<p>How had she even done this?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve got the gist of it,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;Now, unless you want to be a <em>skewered</em> little fishy, you should stay put.&#160; You and me are going to have a conversation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He took in a deep breath.&#160; &#8220;Okay.&#160; A conversation.&#160; I have money, though it isn&#8217;t worth much, I&#8217;ve got food stores enough to last a winter&#8230; we can stretch it thin if we have to.&#160; I&#8217;ve got territory<em>.&#160; </em>Good amount of product.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The product is our first topic of conversation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can take all of it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She sighed.&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to take it.&#160; For one thing, I <em>know</em> it&#8217;s bad stuff, people getting sick.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You heard?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I laced it,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>And</em> I heard.&#160; Thing is, I&#8217;m not interested in grabbing your stuff.&#160; Just the opposite.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You ruined my product so you could sell me yours.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Will you <em>stop talking</em>?&#8221; she asked.&#160; &#8220;Longer this conversation goes, the more tired my hands are going to get, you follow me?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I follow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She set the pointed toe of her boot on the front of the chair, between his knees, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the deal.&#160; You&#8217;re selling drugs.&#160; I kind of have a pet peeve on the subject, I&#8217;m sure you get my drift.&#160; Tattooing people and reigning through terror, they&#8217;re not so cool either, you know?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ah.&#160; A vigilante.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No.&#160; Will you shut your goddamn mouth?&#160; You keep being <em>wrong</em>, and one of the reasons I&#8217;d make a pretty piss-poor vigilante is I&#8217;m the type of person who&#8217;d let go of this chain if you annoyed me enough.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8230; Mm hmm,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Plan was I&#8217;d <em>traipse</em> in here, fuck up your shit, leave a calling card, and then leave.&#160; Sort of a modus operandus, you know?&#160; I&#8217;m working on building a rep as a&#8230; not-assassin.&#160; A shit fucker-upper, if you will.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Modus operand<em>i</em>,&#8221; he replied, a reflexive response.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oops!&#8221; she said.&#160; He dropped, the chain rasping as it ran through the hook in the ceiling.</p>\n<p>He stopped short, a half-second later.&#160; His yelp of a scream was belated, following the <em>stopping</em> rather than the fall.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What was I saying?&#160; Right.&#160; Well.&#160; I happened to overhear your whole deal, and now I&#8217;ve got a problem.&#160; It sounds really, <em>really</em> familiar.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Supporting the territory, ruling with a measure of fear?&#160; I&#8217;ve seen people go this route.&#160; They did it more instinctively.&#160; This felt <em>forced</em>, right here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is how I operate,&#8221; Nero spoke.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t buy it.&#160; Look, there&#8217;s not that many major players out there.&#160; Fewer still who&#8217;ve got all the dirty details, and who&#8217;d be in a position to know certain things.&#160; Let&#8217;s stop pretending you have the memory of a <em>goldfish</em>.&#160; You got help.&#160; What you&#8217;re doing here, it took resources to establish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;My power, I can <em>make</em> things.&#160; Tools, raw materials, weapons.&#160; I have resources in abundance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Giving you five seconds.&#160; Then I let go, and I interrogate Hooligan.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hooligan?&#8221;&#160; his eyes moved in the direction of the room Hooligan had entered, but he couldn&#8217;t see around the side of the desk.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A little tied up at the moment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And Lucan?&#8221;</p>\n<p>As if the question had prompted it, there was a knock at the door.</p>\n<p>Imp&#8217;s eyes met Nero&#8217;s.&#160; For a long moment, the pair were very still.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; Imp called out.</p>\n<p>The door opened.&#160; Three youths entered.&#160; A young teenaged boy with wild blond curls, a ten year old with straight black hair, and another girl, one or two years younger with a manic grin and her dark hair cut in a pixie style.&#160; All wore black.</p>\n<p>Nero relaxed his neck, letting his head dangle.&#160; A slight groan passed through his lips.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Close the door?&#8221; Imp asked.</p>\n<p>The blond boy did.&#160; Ahead of him, the grinning child ran across the room, hopping up onto the desk with enough force that she slid bodily into Imp.</p>\n<p>Nero let out an involuntary noise of alarm, as if convinced Imp would let go.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So, to get you brats caught up, Nero and I were talking, and I can&#8217;t help but feel like there&#8217;s something <em>fishy</em> with this whole business.&#160; Too familiar, really.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Familiar how?&#8221; the blond boy asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Like he&#8217;s copying someone I knew.&#160; Except I <em>know</em> there was nobody like him in the area, watching and taking notes.&#160; Raises questions,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>Nero piped up, his voice a little strangled, &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like that, honest!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s playing <em>dumb</em>, which is really <em>piscine </em>me off,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s two fish lines, now,&#8221; the blond boy said.&#160; He had his hands jammed into his pockets.&#160; &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dudes,&#8221; Imp said, turning around to get a better look at him.&#160; &#8220;Did I finally just pull off a reference you ankle-biters didn&#8217;t get?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The girl with straight hair crossed the room until she stood beside Nero.&#160; Her voice was a quiet deadpan as she stared down at him, &#8220;Nero, not Nemo.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;&#160; Imp asked.&#160; She turned around.&#160; &#8220;Wait, what?&#160; No!&#160; Really?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The blond boy nodded as he smirked a little.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No!&#160; Oh god, no!&#160; All this time spent on fucking setting up, hammering shit into the floor so the chair wouldn&#8217;t slide, getting that fucking hook in the ceiling, and I spoil it by getting the name wrong!?&#160; No!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hey,&#8221; Nero piped up, &#8220;Don&#8217;t- don&#8217;t drop me.&#160; You can&#8217;t&#8230; don&#8217;t let kids this young see something that gruesome.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The youngest girl hopped off of the desk.&#160; She laughed in Nero&#8217;s face, abrupt, a little too enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>Imp extended one foot, catching the hood of the girl&#8217;s sweatshirt and using it to haul her back, before hooking her leg around the girl&#8217;s neck, pinning her.&#160; The girl didn&#8217;t resist.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Really, Nero?&#8221; the blond boy asked.&#160; &#8220;I seem to recall a bit about beating and torturing that brother and sister pair in the other room.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re <em>all</em> parahumans,&#8221; Nero realized, out loud.&#160; It might have been the statement that clued him in, or it might have been the way that one of the kids moved, showing off the golden icon on their sleeves.</p>\n<p>Imp was barely paying attention.&#160; &#8220;Damn it.&#160; But&#8230; who&#8217;s Nero, then?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Roman emperor,&#8221; the blond boy said.&#160; &#8220;Was supposedly a bad leader, which is ironic, given this guy&#8217;s choice of vocation, but that might have been historians being dicks to a guy who they didn&#8217;t agree with.&#160; Stories say he played his instrument while Rome burned.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ughh,&#8221; Imp groaned.&#160; &#8220;There&#8217;s no fish in that story at all.&#160; Wait, was he the one that fucked his mom?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Killed his mom.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Definitely</em> no fish then.&#160; Fuck!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No other choice,&#8221; the girl with straight hair said, her voice quiet.&#160; She pressed her thumb against Nero&#8217;s forehead.&#160; &#8220;Have to let him go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No murdering, Juliette,&#8221; the boy said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No murdering,&#8221; Imp reiterated, as if reciting a phrase she&#8217;d said so many times it was routine.&#160; She looked down.&#160; &#8220;You going to sit still for once, Flor?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The girl with the pixie cut nodded.&#160; Imp released her.&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s better.&#160; Hands are getting tired enough without me sitting in a bad position too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can take over,&#8221; Juliette said, with no inflection to her voice.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah, no, not falling for that one again.&#160; So, <em>Nero</em>, Why don&#8217;t we get this dialogue moving, and you give me the answers I want, or you can get shivved from behind like your second favorite emperor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The blond boy made a &#8216;so-so&#8217; gesture with his hand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fuck you,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;This witty villain banter is a bitch to do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Stop trying,&#8221; Juliette said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m siding with Juliette, here,&#8221; the blond boy said.&#160; &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re not the type for-&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp used her power, disappearing and then reappearing in quick succession.&#160; Not enough to be forgotten <em>entirely</em>.</p>\n<p>She drew in a bit of a breath, then launched into it.&#160; &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we get this dialogue moving, then?&#160; Give me the answers I want, or the only instruments playing at the end of <em>this</em> story will be your voice.&#160; Screaming.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The blond boy gave her a thumbs down.</p>\n<p>She used her power.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Start talking, <em>Emperor,</em>&#8221; she intoned, sounding just a little weary.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to say.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s really only two answers to this little dilemma of ours,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Either you&#8217;re lying, badly, or you&#8217;re under some crazy compulsion.&#160; If it&#8217;s the latter, you&#8217;re about a hair away from <em>deserving</em> a violent end.&#160; If it&#8217;s the&#8230; <em>what</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The blond boy was shaking his head.&#160; &#8220;Former, then latter.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp used her power.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are two real answers to this situation, here,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Either you&#8217;re doing a fucking shitty job of lying, or you&#8217;re under some kind of compulsion.&#160; If it&#8217;s the <em>former</em>, I&#8217;m not seeing a reason to keep holding on.&#160; If it&#8217;s the <em>latter</em>, then I&#8217;m not seeing much of a reason to carry on with this fucking conversation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Or</em>,&#8221; Nero said, his eyes wide behind the eyeholes of his helmet, &#8220;I&#8217;m telling the <em>truth</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If <em>that&#8217;s</em> the case,&#8221; Imp said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to feel <em>really</em> crummy about this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can barely think.&#160; I think this chain might be cutting off circulation&#8230; I&#8217;ve got spotty bits in my memory.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Cope,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Here we go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Five,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Four&#8230; three&#8230; two&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Teacher,&#8221; Nero said, quick, abrupt.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear anything,&#8221; Juliette said, putting a finger in one ear and wiggling it a bit, as if cleaning it.&#160; &#8220;What a shame.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Teacher</em>?&#8221;&#160; Imp asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You forgot the part where you let go of the chain,&#8221; Juliette reminded her.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; the blond boy said.&#160; He gave her a hug from behind.&#160; &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll get your murder next time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nero gave the youths a wary look, then broke into an explanation, rushing a touch, &#8220;Teacher.&#160; He gave me the plan, told me what to do.&#160; So long as I follow his game plan, I get supplies I can&#8217;t get with my power, stuff you&#8217;d need forged.&#160; Documents and hard cash.&#160; He unlocked my power, too.&#160; Used to be I could only make a few things.&#160; Darts, I know where my stuff is, so I could tag people, track-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re rambling,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Rambling is good.&#160; Better than playing stupid.&#160; But maybe focus a bit, here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Um.&#160; Uh.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The game plan,&#8221; Imp prodded him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He gave me guidelines.&#160; There&#8217;s a whole list of things I have to do, times to do them.&#160; I send in weekly reports, he sends me updated instructions.&#160; I, um.&#160; I&#8217;m not the only one.&#160; There are others.&#160; He told me he knows there&#8217;s no guarantee I&#8217;ll work out, so the instructions differ, and so do the people following them.&#160; If one of us succeeds, he steps up the rewards, helps us become even more powerful.&#160; We fail or we tell someone, and we&#8217;re on our own.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And, so long as <em>someone</em> succeeds,&#8221; Imp thought aloud, &#8220;He&#8217;s connected to someone in power.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nero shook his head, then nodded a second later.&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t- maybe.&#160; He said he wasn&#8217;t interested in power for power&#8217;s sake.&#160; That you couldn&#8217;t be the guy working from the shadows and the guy wearing the crown at the same time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not going to say that to the guy who wants to wear the crown,&#8221; the blond boy said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Nero said.&#160; &#8220;I- I&#8217;m not disagreeing.&#160; I&#8217;m, I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221;&#160; Imp asked.&#160; &#8220;Trust me, you don&#8217;t want to hold anything back here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What- what do you want to know?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The drugs.&#160; Who from?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;NY-C.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;This <em>really</em> isn&#8217;t the time to act clever,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Clever?&#160; No.&#160; No!&#160; Not New York City.&#160; New York <em>C</em>.&#160; There&#8217;s a cartel based in that dimension, on the island.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Powers?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; The leader&#8217;s a trump.&#160; Even the Wardens are leaving them alone, &#8217;cause of it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp nodded.&#160; &#8220;One of you three remember that for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And by one of us three,&#8221; the blond boy said, &#8220;You mean me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why Samuel?&#8221; Juliette asked, in her characteristic deadpan.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m trustworthy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;More details, Emperor.&#160; Be <em>inventive</em>,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Dig deep, come up with something I want to hear.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8230; no.&#160; I can&#8217;t think of anything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp sighed.&#160; &#8220;Right.&#160; Then I suppose we&#8217;re done.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been talking too long,&#8221; Samuel said.&#160; He glanced down at Juliette.&#160; &#8220;He probably won&#8217;t forget the whole encounter if you use your power.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Let&#8217;s use Flor, then.&#8221;</p>\n<p>All eyes fell on the girl with the pixie cut.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Um,&#8221; Nero said.&#160; &#8220;Who is she?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Flor turned, as if to double check it was okay.&#160; She couldn&#8217;t even stand still, shifting her weight from foot to foot, fidgeting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Go,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>Flor virtually <em>leaped</em> onto Nero&#8217;s chest, grabbing the chain to avoid sliding right over his chest and falling on the far side.&#160; Imp was left to reassert her own grip on the chain before the added weight could drive the villain down into the ground and the waiting nails and knives.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fuck!&#8221;&#160; Imp swore, when she&#8217;d fixed her grip.&#160; &#8220;Damn it, Flor!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The girl straddled Nero&#8217;s chest, her eyes over his.&#160; She grinned, showing all of her teeth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Is she- is she going to eat my face?&#8221;&#160; Nero asked.&#160; &#8220;She looks like she&#8217;s going to eat my face.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The rules,&#8221; Samuel prompted Imp.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Rule one.&#160; No drugs,&#8221;&#160; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to look at them, talk about them, hear about them, touch them, use them or trade in them.&#160; No more poisoning families and ruining lives.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nero twitched, then burst into song, full volume,&#160; &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m a little teapot, short and stout!</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not quite the deterrent we had in mind,&#8221; Samuel said.&#160; &#8220;We-</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Here is my handle, here is my spout!</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Samuel relaxed a touch.&#160; &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s doing the full song.&#160; That&#8217;s a little better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>When I get all steamed up, I just shout!</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Listen, Nero,&#8221;&#160; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Every time you-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Tip me over and pour me out!</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;-meet the criteria we set, you&#8217;re going to do this all over again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>I&#8217;m a very special pot, it&#8217;s true!</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, wow, there&#8217;s more lyrics?&#8221; Imp asked, her train of thought temporarily broken.</p>\n<p>Nero&#8217;s eyes moved from person to person, clearly alarmed as his lips worked without his volition.&#160; &#8220;<em>Here&#8217;s an example of what I can do!</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp nodded, &#8220;Carve a guy&#8217;s face up with a knife, you get some crazy face-stitchy nemesis, and his cred goes <em>up-&#8220;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>I can turn my handle into a spout!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;-but if you turn him into the guy that sings the teapot song-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Tip me over and pour me out!</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;-he&#8217;s going to have a hell of a time in the villain community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The song was done, and Nero was left panting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Especially if he&#8217;s doing the dance along with it,&#8221; Samuel commented.&#160; &#8220;His hands and hips were wiggling there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp sighed.&#160; &#8220;Flor.&#160; Let us finish explaining before you decide what the rule is.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Samuel added, &#8220;You make another guy sing &#8216;John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt&#8217; and I&#8217;m not sure we can get them to <em>stop</em>, this time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can <em>always</em> get them to stop,&#8221; Juliette commented, quiet, &#8220;But that breaks Imp&#8217;s rules.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Flor only grinned, staring down at Nero.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Rule two,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Please, no.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If he breaks it, Flor, I want him to throw away any weapon or phone he has and then launch into reciting aloud from a copy of the <em>Iliad </em>for an hour.&#160; <em>Before</em> he attacks.<em>&#8220;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Nero said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Rule is, no attacking anyone, and no giving orders that lead to anyone or anyone&#8217;s belongings getting hurt or lost.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Nero shouted.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;re killing me, leaving me defenseless!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re declawing you, <em>old man</em>,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;You figure it out.&#160; Sam, help me get him down?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Being the only trustworthy one sucks ass,&#8221; Samuel said.&#160; &#8220;Move, Flor.&#160; Leave the poor bastard alone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Flor hopped down.&#160; Nero yelled as the chair rocked a little.</p>\n<p>Sam kicked the board of knives and nails to one side, and Imp lowered Nero to the ground.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re done,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>Nero backed away, freezing as he found himself beside Juliette, who had picked up the board of spikes and was holding the safe side against her chest, her arms having found safe spots.</p>\n<p>Imp looked down at the armored man.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;re fucking with an old friend, using her schtick, taking it ugly places.&#160; So it looks like I have a bit of a hobby, now.&#160; If you get in touch with Teach, or vice versa, then let him know I&#8217;m not cool with it, and I&#8217;ll stop being a thorn in his side the day he stops cribbing from someone else&#8217;s game plan.&#160; <em>Capiche</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nero couldn&#8217;t bring himself to answer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about legacies,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Kind of important.&#160; She&#8217;s gone, so it&#8217;s up to us to protect her legacy.&#160; Now here&#8217;s another.&#160; Desk drawer, bottom right.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You won,&#8221; Nero said.&#160; &#8220;You won the moment you had a chain around my neck.&#160; You took my ability to fight, you prevented me from&#8230; certain avenues of business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fast learner,&#8221; Samuel observed.</p>\n<p>Imp crossed the room to the doorway that Hooligan and the teenagers had entered, rubbing kinks out of her hands.&#160; She opened the door.&#160; &#8220;No need to watch him anymore.&#160; Go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The two teenagers fled.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Desk drawer,&#8221; Imp said, when they were gone.</p>\n<p>Nero edged over to the desk, then opened the drawer.</p>\n<p>When he raised his hand, there was a stuffed doll in it.&#160; Crude.&#160; A figure in white with a silver crown and ruby lips.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to check in on you from time to time,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a rule.&#160; That doll?&#160; It&#8217;s in your care.&#160; It stays <em>pristine</em>, you get it?&#160; If anything happens to it, if there&#8217;s the slightest scuff, then I&#8217;m going to be <em>pissed</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nero looked down at the doll.&#160; &#8220;<em>Why</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m <em>mysterious</em>,&#8221; Imp said, sounding very lucid, and suddenly tired.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll be in touch, to check in on you and that doll.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She turned to leave, then stopped.&#160; &#8220;And no mentioning the fish thing, or you&#8217;ll see me <em>really</em> pissed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nero nodded slowly.</p>\n<p>With that said, Imp led the way out of the office, leaving the former villain staring down at the poorly made doll.</p>\n<p>The three kids grabbed their jackets from beside the door, pulling them on.</p>\n<p>They collectively ventured outside into the darkness, the cold and the snow.&#160; The snow had frozen into a shelf of ice above powder, crunching under their footsteps.&#160; Flor reached her arms out to either side, as if trying to embrace the wind.&#160; She nearly fell, up until her brother caught her.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That doll?&#160; Was that supposed to be Regent?&#8221;&#160; Samuel asked.&#160; He adjusted his scarf.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gotta ask. &#160;<em>Why?</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Legacies,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Memorial went kablooie when Scion hit Brockton Bay original, which bugs me more than it should.&#160; I mean, okay, going on a tangent here, I had a shitty childhood, y&#8217;know?&#160; You guys can relate, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What tipped you off?&#8221; Juliette asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gut feeling,&#8221; Imp retorted, &#8220;Most wouldn&#8217;t guess, I know, given how well adjusted you rugrats are.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a couple years younger than you,&#8221; Samuel said.&#160; &#8220;Why am I a rugrat?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Anyways,</em>&#8221; Imp said, ignoring the question, &#8220;I had a shitty childhood.&#160; You go through that, and the people who matter end up mattering <em>a fucking lot</em>, you know?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Samuel said, at the same time Juliette said, &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sucks to fade into the background, let me tell you.&#160; Not even talking about my power.&#160; It really&#8230; sucks.&#160; And I think, you know, I&#8217;m not very good at taking care of people.&#160; You lot excepted, almost all of those people who mattered are gone, one way or another.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mostly the one way,&#8221; Juliette said.&#160; Samuel elbowed her.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mostly the one way,&#8221; Imp agreed.&#160; &#8220;And I can&#8217;t do much.&#160; I&#8217;m not the type to take flowers to graves or anything like that.&#160; I&#8217;m not the type to cry, and sometimes I <em>really</em> wish I was.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You make sure they&#8217;re remembered,&#8221; Samuel said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That they don&#8217;t fade away or get ignored.&#160; I&#8217;m <em>trying</em>.&#160; But how do you even do that?&#160; I gotta go with my gut, and my gut says that <em>one </em>friend ought to get a fair shake, after the fact.&#160; So maybe I do my part, make sure history isn&#8217;t a dick to her.&#160; And for your <em>brother</em>, well&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Making people take care of puppets?&#8221;&#160; Samuel asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel like he&#8217;d get it,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; Samuel said, &#8220;Because <em>I</em> sure don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;He, I don&#8217;t even know&#8230; he liked irritating people, needling them.&#160; Shad- <em>schadenfreude</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Samuel gave Imp a thumbs up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes!&#160; Woo!&#160; Schadenfreude.&#160; Pronounced it right.&#160; So he&#8217;d get a kick out of making people miserable over something so minor and silly.&#160; I dunno.&#160; It was one of his better points.&#160; He was a magnificent asshole.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Aisha was a big fan of Jean-Paul&#8217;s asshole,&#8221; Juliette said.&#160; &#8220;You catch that, Flor?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Flor nodded, grinning.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You guys are <em>dicks</em>,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s <em>not</em> what I said.&#160; Gross, no, and <em>fuck you</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Samuel fixed Flor&#8217;s scarf to cover her face, then fixed the scarf in place by clamping the earmuffs down over scarf and ear both.&#160; &#8220;Close enough.&#160; We&#8217;ll be sure to inform the rest of the gang about your fetish when we get back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You probably <em>would</em>,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;How do you even know what a fet- nevermind.&#160; Dumb question.&#160; Cold is getting to me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right.&#160; The cold.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Flor was starting to struggle, being the shortest member of the group.&#160; Imp picked her up, swinging her around until she had her in a piggyback position.</p>\n<p>The snow crunched underfoot.&#160; Though it was nighttime, the light of the sun reflected off of the moon, and the snow reflected that light in turn.&#160; It was more fitting to twilight than midnight, now that her eyes had adjusted.&#160; The buildings looked grim, stark and utilitarian.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only person that isn&#8217;t family that has ever had the guts to touch Florence,&#8221; Samuel commented.</p>\n<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not that bad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; Samuel said.&#160; &#8220;Except, you know, the time she compelled a complete stranger to slap his forehead any time he wanted to talk.&#160; There was the one cop that had to bite himself hard enough to draw blood every time he made eye contact with someone.&#160; Or the time Nathan, one of our unpowered brothers, yelled at her, and she made it so he had to turn around ten times before he entered a room, and had to count backwards from a hundred before he could put food in his mouth.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;He got thin,&#8221; Juliette said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nathan was almost dead, last time we saw him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp ignored the chatter, but she felt a little more at ease than she had earlier.&#160; Sam said something, then elbowed Juliette, who offered only a comment, inflection free.</p>\n<p>Imp watched them to make sure that no weapons were drawn, literal or otherwise.&#160; It was in the process that a blur caught her eye.</p>\n<p>A shadow in the distance, perched on a building.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Do you sense her?&#8221;&#160; Imp asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Her?&#8221;&#160; Sam asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Guess not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Trouble?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Imp replied.&#160; She let Flor down to the ground, then faced the figure head on.&#160; With a broad gesture, she beckoned for the figure to approach.</p>\n<p>The figure didn&#8217;t move.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Bitch,&#8221; Imp muttered.&#160; &#8220;Gimme a minute.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She stopped suppressing her power, and she could see the faces of the others change.&#160; Confusion.</p>\n<p>She felt a bit sad, seeing it, but she could see how they banded together.&#160; It wasn&#8217;t the most <em>healthy</em> sibling dynamic, but they were together.&#160; There were more back at the headquarters.&#160; Her family.</p>\n<p>She turned to go.&#160; Trudging across the snow, passing between two buildings because it was the fastest route, stopping because the angle was different, struggling to use the falling snowflakes to gauge if the telltale blur was there or if here eyes were playing tricks on her.</p>\n<p>It took minutes, but she found her way up the scaffolding at the side of the building.</p>\n<p>She kicked the pile of snow to the ground below, then sat down beside Shadow Stalker&#8217;s blurry form.&#160; When she was settled, she suppressed her power.</p>\n<p>Together, they watched the trio of Heartbreaker&#8217;s children make their way down a road that was buried beneath snow.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You touch any of them, you&#8217;re-&#8221;</p>\n<p>Shadow Stalker was reacting before the sentence was done.&#160; Imp remained where she was.&#160; Too close to be shot.&#160; The bolts took time to phase into reality.</p>\n<p>A moment later, Shadow Stalker had leaped across the roof and was frozen there, weapon pointed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I was saying,&#8221; Imp said, not looking away from the hills and trees that glittered with snow, &#8220;You touch them, you&#8217;re <em>really</em> going to regret it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was thinking of taking <em>you</em> down,&#8221; Shadow Stalker said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even dumber,&#8221; Imp replied.&#160; &#8220;They&#8217;re pretty scary people, and I think some of them even <em>like</em> me.&#160; I mean, really, do you want to fuck with <em>that</em> nest of hornets?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t matter.&#160; Situation didn&#8217;t call for it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp shrugged.&#160; &#8220;All the villains out there, and you pick <em>us</em>?&#160; There&#8217;s a reason.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some stuff was left unresolved,&#8221; Shadow Stalker said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Regent</em> stuff?&#160; Oh, hey, if you really want to get into that stuff, we could <em>bond</em>.&#160; Paint each other&#8217;s nails, do the frozen bra sleepover thing, I always wanted to do that.&#160; I could talk about how fond I was of him, and you could talk about wanting to kill him, and then we both commiserate over heartbreak, in the various forms it takes.&#160; Then, if we&#8217;ve had a few drinks along the way&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp trailed off.</p>\n<p>Shadow Stalker didn&#8217;t move a muscle, her crossbow trained on her.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No?&#160; Not game?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;He told you, explained it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Explained what?&#160; No way!&#160; Did you really have a thing going?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What?&#160; No!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh.&#160; Damn.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re fucking with me.&#160; Trying to put me off balance, taunting me with the lesbian innuendo.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I taunt <em>everyone</em> with that kind of stuff.&#160; Geez, you&#8217;re tightly strung.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me like I&#8217;m your friend, and we won&#8217;t have a problem.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp sighed, watching as the trio of Heartbroken made their way down a road without cars.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wearing that fucking thing on your arm.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp looked down at the golden circle the survivors of the Scion fight had taken to wearing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Every time I see it, I can&#8217;t help but imagine it&#8217;s a bullseye.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pisses you off?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t <em>earn</em> our victory, and people wear that shit like it&#8217;s a badge of honor.&#160; We were <em>puppets</em>, we got <em>used</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;By <em>her</em>,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t her power.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Was too.&#160; Trust me on this.&#160; I saw it unfold.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Shadow Stalker looked away.&#160; She holstered the crossbow.&#160; &#8220;Fuck it.&#160; Not worth the effort.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Awesome,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;You know how many people underestimated <em>her</em>?&#160; Right up until the end.&#160; I&#8217;m <em>glad</em> to be underestimated.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re trying to irritate me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re fun to irritate.&#160; And you know, it&#8217;s cool.&#160; In the end, you&#8217;re one of the people that&#8217;s going to remember her.&#160; Someone that&#8217;s left, who knows the general story.&#160; I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s the schadenfreude type, but I think she&#8217;d appreciate that it&#8217;s true, and that it nettles you just a little.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; Shadow Stalker said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right, ms. &#8216;Unresolved&#8217;.&#160; You aren&#8217;t holding on to the past at all.&#160; It doesn&#8217;t unsettle you or leave you feeling like you want to hit something when you think about it too much.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It <em>doesn&#8217;t</em>,&#8221; Shadow Stalker said.&#160; &#8220;You want to keep putting words in my mouth, I&#8217;ll put a crossbow bolt through yours.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;re not bothered <em>at all</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m alive, she&#8217;s not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the rest of your years, even if you <em>try</em>, which you won&#8217;t, you won&#8217;t make a fraction of the difference she made.&#160; You&#8217;re going to keep living this solitary little hunter-stalker existence, picking off a few bad guys, getting your jollies, and people are never going to wear a badge on their sleeves for you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That badge is <em>not</em> for Hebert.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maybe not for everyone,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;It means different things for different people.&#160; A planet they lost, an ordeal they survived, I dunno.&#160; But it&#8217;s a reminder of Taylor to <em>me</em>, and it&#8217;s a reminder for <em>you, </em>too.&#160; Every time you see it, now, it&#8217;s going to make you think of her, remind you that she did something <em>big</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Shadow Stalker drew the crossbow, aiming it, but Imp was already using her power.</p>\n<p>Shadow Stalker stood there in a daze for a moment, then holstered her crossbow.&#160; She fidgeted, pacing back and forth, then snarled aloud, kicking at a lump of snow at the edge of the roof, sending it up in a relatively pitiful flurry.</p>\n<p>Anger with no outlet.</p>\n<p>Imp smiled, getting to her feet, then made her way down.</p>\n<p>She trudged the distance to the car, parking a distance away.&#160; Samuel was leaning against the passenger door.&#160; She jerked her thumb, ordering him to move.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; he asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re driving.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Learn fast,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ice and snow everywhere.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Four wheel drive.&#160; Don&#8217;t care if it takes a while to get there.&#160; Besides, you can sense people, worst thing you can hit is a wall.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You say that like it&#8217;s <em>only</em> a wall.&#160; Whatever.&#160; Any reason for this?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a mood to read.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Read?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp shrugged.&#160; Samuel relented and walked around to the driver&#8217;s side, while Imp climbed into her seat.&#160; The two younger girls got in the back.</p>\n<p>It took him a few seconds to get the car started successfully.&#160; The vehicle lurched into motion.&#160; Very, very slowly.</p>\n<p>Imp brought her knees up to her chest, then draped a blanket around herself, getting her book-reader out.&#160; A quick check showed she had a message from Tattletale.</p>\n<p>A meeting?</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Aisha&#8217;s</em> legacy,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Becoming a cultured, badass supervillain, phase number&#8230; something.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Samuel offered a wry comment, &#8220;Hearing you talk like that, I feel reassured.&#160; You&#8217;re obviously well on your way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Focus on the road, brainiac.&#160; I&#8217;m not in a rush, and I&#8217;m gonna do this right, if I&#8217;m going to become a villain awesome enough to match up to who the original Regent and Imp were going to be as a <em>pair</em>.&#160; What am I reading?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Twenty thousand leagues under the sea,&#8221; Samuel said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gotcha,&#8221; Imp said, looking down to the book too quickly to catch his smirk.</p>\n'<h1 id="chap9">Teneral e.3</h1>b'<p>Hard load engaged.&#160;

his voice had a bit of a rasp to it.&#160; &#8220;Have to wait.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He stood, nearly falling, and caught himself with one hand.&#160; Warning indicators blinked at the edges of his field of vision.&#160; &#8220;Right.&#160; Forgot.&#160; I&#8217;ve been slacking on the maintenance.&#160; Embarrassing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He shifted his weight carefully onto one leg, then experimentally moved the other.&#160; There was no strength in the movement.&#160; Fully extended, it was steady.&#160; Bent, there was minimal support.</p>\n<p>He straightened, then ran his hands down the length of his upper body.&#160; The divides between the flesh he&#8217;d been born with and the synthetic flesh were seamless, almost indistinguishable.&#160; Except the way his flesh generated sweat differed from the beading of moisture on the synthetic skin.&#160; This, in turn, reflected the light in a different manner.&#160; The sun was shining outside, but there were few lights inside the cabin of the craft.&#160; The light streamed inside in shafts.</p>\n<p>It would have been easier to see the screens without the glare, but he&#8217;d kept the windows uncovered.&#160; A way of tracking the passage of days.&#160; The scruff on his cheeks was a clue, but as long as he shaved it, it measured the hours and not the days.&#160; He&#8217;d taken to the most economical method of cutting his hair and using a razor with an attachment, running the device over his scalp a few times once a week or so.</p>\n<p>It was, he mused, the failure of his mechanical parts that helped him track the passage of time, more than any natural progression in his natural body.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No need to panic,&#8221; he murmured, his voice gravelly, as if he&#8217;d just woken from a long sleep.&#160; He kept one leg extended and rigid as he limped across the length of the ship.&#160; He accessed a locker with a set movement of his eyes, registering key points on the panel, and then opened it.&#160; A suit of armor with a spear propped up inside it, like a warrior laid at rest.</p>\n<p>Piece by piece, he attached his <em>Defiant</em> armor to his lower body.&#160; Boots, panels around the calves, knees, thighs, hips.&#160; Each piece connected to the others.</p>\n<p>Once it was all pieced together, he moved his leg again, setting his weight down on it.&#160; He stretched, testing it for flexibility and the ability to bear weight.&#160; It was the armor handling the task, not his leg, but it served.</p>\n<p>He resisted the urge to take hold of the spear, shutting the locker instead.&#160; By the time he turned towards the door, it was already opening, the entire ship thrumming with the mechanisms at work.</p>\n<p>Stopping at the threshold between the ship&#8217;s interior and the outside world, he activated a different sequence.&#160; Devices mounted at strategic positions pointed sets of lasers at the walls.&#160; Script was drawn out on each open space.</p>\n<p>He could look at it and intuitively know what he was looking at.&#160; He could see the complete whole.&#160; Fainter script indicated processes running in the background.</p>\n<p>With a simple command, the lasers shut off and monitors went to sleep.&#160; The interior of the ship was cast in darkness.</p>\n<p>Frost-dusted grass was flattened beneath the heavy tread of his boots.&#160; Here and there, there were crunching and scraping sounds where the textured metal soles found stones on or just beneath the ground&#8217;s surface.&#160; He left behind footprints that were two inches deep, more angular than curved.</p>\n<p>His breath fogged, but he barely felt the cold.&#160; Various components and engines in his body kicked into action, offering warmth by way of waste and secondary functions.&#160; The synthetic skin weathered the cold and held in the heat.&#160; Efficiency, detail and effective use of waste were critical aspects of his particular brand of tinkering.</p>\n<p>Everything was connected, but no connection was perfect.&#160; There was entropy in all things.</p>\n<p>In anything, there was a cost.&#160; A price to be paid.</p>\n<p>He sat at a point on the hill where a rocky outcropping formed a ledge.</p>\n<p>A city was spread out beneath him, people going about their business.&#160; The locals had captured some <em>Tarpan</em>, though the unruly creatures were almost more trouble than they were worth.&#160; They were to horses what neanderthals were to men, with thicker, shorter necks, shorter snouts and stubborn, skittish personalities.&#160; Time would tell if the attempts at creating working vehicles would succeed before the domestication of the Tarpan.</p>\n<p>Still, the wild beasts pulled wagons loaded with goods and building supplies.</p>\n<p>It was a society evolving with surprising speed.&#160; When they had started, they&#8217;d had only what they brought with them, and they&#8217;d had knowledge.</p>\n<p>When the battle had been declared over, they had been given a choice.&#160; To stay here, or to try and rebuild <em>there</em>.</p>\n<p>These were the ones who had stayed.&#160; They had formed crude lodgings and tools, using those to subsist until they could fashion better things.&#160; By the time the first month was over, they had been reinforcing their homes, layering planks over the logs, or chinking the cracks.&#160; Food was foraged, hunted, or traded for, stored for the winter.</p>\n<p>Every step of the way, they had worked beside a nearby hill, where a great metal craft was perched, staring out over the horizon.&#160; A dragon, layered in armor, vageuly squat and brutish as dragons went, much like the Tarpan.</p>\n<p>Maybe the residents found it reassuring to have something powerful and <em>human </em>nearby, but only a few had dared approach.&#160; They hadn&#8217;t shared a language, but they&#8217;d reached an accord, nonetheless.&#160; They left him alone, he did them the same favor.</p>\n<p>A vapor flowed from his body as he sat in the sun.&#160; Heat and cold, the air freezing as it got further from him.</p>\n<p>Children were playing in a field below.&#160; A single person, a team of two, and a team of three.&#160; The kids had their arms linked with other members of their group, and the biggest group was running from the lone kid, with the pair working to block his path.&#160; The activity had them practically tripping over one another, collapsing in piles of colorful winter clothing.&#160; He could see the clouds of frozen breath as they laughed.</p>\n<p>Everything had a price, but the inverse was also true.&#160; Good things came from sacrifice.&#160; They&#8217;d fought Scion, lives had been lost, and they&#8217;d sacrificed much more, besides, but there were children here, now.&#160; There was a <em>future</em>.</p>\n<p>A group emerged from the city.&#160; Three men, two women, two children.&#160; Talking.&#160; He could see one of them look up at him, the rest following the gaze.</p>\n<p>A wave.&#160; He raised a hand by way of response.&#160; Something in him broke.</p>\n<p>Two things, really, but he didn&#8217;t want to devote too much attention to that.&#160; It was easy to get wrapped up in those things.&#160; His focus was limited to a small computer that had been embedded in his forearm.&#160; The system used <em>light</em> for its circuits, rather than electricity, and it generated a lot of heat as a byproduct.&#160; It had failed, a housing for one circuit breaking, and now his arm was swiftly getting colder.</p>\n<p>He lowered his arm, then sandwiched it between his other arm and his stomach, hunching over a little.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>There you are,</em>&#8221; he murmured.</p>\n<p>One of the women in the group had broken away.&#160; She was holding a small child&#8217;s hand, leading her away.&#160; The child looked back towards other familiar adults, as if for reassurance, and they smiled.</p>\n<p>They joined the game the children in the field were playing, the woman calling out in a language he couldn&#8217;t understand.&#160; Suggesting changes for the rules, fitting new people into the game.</p>\n<p>Now there were two groups that were simultaneously trying to catch the other side&#8217;s &#8216;king&#8217; while protecting their own.&#160; Adult and toddler together made for an awkward pair, but the woman made it work, lifting the child out of reach when someone got close, moving with long, sure strides.</p>\n<p>At some point, kids started to watch just to see what she was doing, instead of playing.&#160; They turned on her, in a playful way, her &#8216;defenders&#8217; now trying to help encircle her, while she avoided them, lifting the little girl here and there.&#160; She made it look effortless.</p>\n<p>But the kids, six all together, managed to surround her.&#160; They tackled her to the ground, and collectively collapsed in a heap.&#160; There was laughter again, alongside pants of near-exhaustion.</p>\n<p>His eyes weren&#8217;t real eyes anymore.&#160; When he watched, he saw with perfect clarity.&#160; There was no mist of frozen breath when she laughed.</p>\n<p>Parents called children to them, and the group broke up.&#160; When the little girl rejoined her parents on the road out of the city, she was smiling, almost skipping.</p>\n<p>The woman, wearing a long skirt and a heavy jacket with a hood, climbed to her feet and made her way up the hill, turning to wave at the people on the road.</p>\n<p>He rose to his feet, then stretched.&#160; More a way of testing what was working and what wasn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Done for the day?&#8221;&#160; she asked, her voice harboring a trace of an accent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d eat with you and then get back to it,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>She placed a hand on the back of his neck, then leaned forward to kiss him.&#160; No comment on the subject, no questions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You want to cook, or should I?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you could, I&#8217;d appreciate it.&#160; I&#8217;m distracted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the mood for anything?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Something light.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You cut an imposing figure, sitting up there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A god on Mount Olympus,&#8221; he mused.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A <em>god</em>?&#160; Getting a little full of yourself, there?&#8221;&#160; She poked him with one gloved finger, making it clear she was joking.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s a hill, not a mountain.&#160; When we have a little snow, kids could toboggan down.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are like the old pantheons, aren&#8217;t we?&#160; We make decisions for our own personal reasons, and the courses of their lives change.&#160; Some of us are little, some big.&#160; Some good, some evil.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And which god are you, oh great lord of Olympus?&#160; I beseech you, name thyself, so I might know what offerings to place before you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What god I am?&#160; Obvious enough, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>She pulled her scarf down a bit, walking backwards.&#160; He followed after her.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once upon a time, I think you would have said Zeus,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;You would have said you forge thunderbolts, in a metaphorical sense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had a phase where I did actually work with electricity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I <em>do</em> remember.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once upon a time, I would have been offended if someone hadn&#8217;t said Zeus, because anything less than being king of the gods would have been an insult.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;Once, that would have been the answer you expected, how you saw yourself.&#160; Now?&#160; I&#8217;d say Hephaestus, but that carries bad connotations, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not as proud as I was,&#8221; he replied.&#160; He declined to mention the fact that his leg wasn&#8217;t working properly, the limp he&#8217;d have if he wasn&#8217;t wearing his armor.&#160; It had been characteristic of the smith god, it wouldn&#8217;t win him any points here if he brought it up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was referring to Hephaestus&#8217; <em>wife</em>, in part.&#160; I wouldn&#8217;t want to be associated with her,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now who&#8217;s being proud?&#8221; he asked.&#160; &#8220;Comparing herself to Aphrodite.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She stuck out her tongue at him, still walking backwards.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Aphrodite was beautiful.&#160; Let&#8217;s, just for a moment, stop overthinking things.&#160; Take it at its face value, ignore the rest.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s doable,&#8221; she said.&#160; She smiled a little.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;ve gotten better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Better?&#160; At not putting my foot in my mouth?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Or being sweet, just a bit.&#160; Or maybe I&#8217;ve spent too much time around you and I can&#8217;t tell the difference between the two anymore.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He tried to offer a genuine smile and failed.&#160; It didn&#8217;t matter.&#160; She wasn&#8217;t looking at him.&#160; She had turned around, looking at the city.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Going well?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;They want to call it Dracheheim,&#8221; she said.&#160; The &#8216;ch&#8217; sound was almost a &#8216;g&#8217;.&#160; A middle ground between the two.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re grateful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to let them do it on their own.&#160; I&#8217;m only working on the things they couldn&#8217;t do themselves.&#160; Power, infrastructure, information, providing information from my libraries, the little I could bring with me&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s stellar,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>She continued staring out over the side of the hill, before turning to give him a curious glance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re usually more talkative.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I talk less, there&#8217;s less room to say something wrong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re tired.&#160; Or sick.&#160; Or something.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He nodded.&#160; &#8220;Admittedly tired.&#160; Very tired.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You still need six minutes of sleep to rest your brain.&#160; You&#8217;re enhanced, but you haven&#8217;t transcended humanity completely.&#160; Did you sleep for six minutes, last night?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he admitted.</p>\n<p>The look she gave him was a concerned one.&#160; &#8220;Colin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you say it&#8217;s fine, then it&#8217;s fine.&#160; But tonight&#8230; maybe we could curl up together, watch some movies?&#160; You&#8217;ve been getting more and more caught up in it, and maybe stepping away will give you perspective again.&#160; A chance to <em>relax</em>, even?&#160; Ten by ten?&#8221;</p>\n<p>He shook his head a little.&#160; &#8220;Your code changes.&#160; I&#8217;m figuring out how it works, I&#8217;m learning the nuances, but I&#8217;m going to lose <em>days</em> worth of analysis if I step away for a whole night.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Here I am, offering you my body,&#8221; she said, offering a mock pout, &#8220;And all you want me for is my brains and personality.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want everything,&#8221; he said, sidestepping the humor.&#160; Frank, blunt, he said, &#8220;<em>All</em> of you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She didn&#8217;t respond.&#160; Had he said the wrong thing?&#160; Or had it been something about the <em>way</em> he&#8217;d said it?</p>\n<p>She approached, and her arm wound around his, her hand sliding into his own.&#160; She paused, looking down.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;re cold.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Reference system broke down, heatsink isn&#8217;t dumping into the channels I set up.&#160; Fixable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She sighed.&#160; There was no mist of frozen breath<em>.&#160; </em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be the nagging girlfriend, but you can understand where I&#8217;m worried, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;In the spirit of honesty, putting all the cards on the table, my leg&#8217;s in bad shape too.&#160; It&#8217;s been months since I had the time to take things apart and fix them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can <em>ask</em>.&#160; A few hours, I can give you a hand, we can find the materials-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know.&#160; I wasn&#8217;t willing to step away, and I could function fine with a bit of wear and tear.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You need a break, you need time to get yourself back into working order and&#8230; again, I don&#8217;t want to push you, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>She stopped.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand what you&#8217;re doing.&#160; I understand why.&#160; I <em>appreciate</em> it.&#160; But I have to ask this, I&#8217;ve been putting it off for weeks, because I&#8217;m afraid of the answer, but now I&#8217;m seeing the state you&#8217;re in&#8230;&#160; Have you made headway?&#160; Have you found a way to undo what Teacher did with my code?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Anger, frustration and exhaustion made his voice rough.&#160; &#8220;No.&#160; No insights on that front.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She nodded, her expression unchanging, and she rubbed his hand between hers to warm it up.&#160; &#8220;I know you want to fix it.&#160; Remove any and all restrictions that keep me from stopping him or anyone he designates.&#160; But there&#8217;s something to be said for being together.&#160; I miss you, you know.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I miss you too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maybe it isn&#8217;t reversible.&#160; Could you make peace with that?&#160; Realize that there is no solution buried in there, that maybe we need to make peace with that?&#160; It&#8217;s a nice town.&#160; They&#8217;re a little intimidated by you, but that&#8217;s fixable.&#160; We could make a home, fill it with references people wouldn&#8217;t get, technology.&#160; Kids?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kids?&#8221;</p>\n<p>She shrugged a little, her shoulder brushing against his.&#160; She said, with a measured offhandedness, &#8220;There are orphans out there who need homes.&#160; Or, you know, we could <em>make</em> a kid?&#8221;</p>\n<p>From very casual to <em>overly</em> casual, in a matter of a second.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure which you mean when you say <em>make</em>, and both possibilities are scary in their own way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Scary</em>?&#8221; she asked, a little archly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;More to the point, I never saw myself as a father.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She nodded, relaxing a little.&#160; More gently, she asked, &#8220;<em>Could</em> you?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he responded.&#160; &#8220;But-&#8221;</p>\n<p>He stopped.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m about to put my foot in my mouth.&#160; Can I call in a &#8216;Colin is an doofus&#8217; chit in advance?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not a <em>doofus</em>, and there&#8217;s no such thing as doofus chits.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We should have them.&#160; I like the idea.&#160; I&#8217;m going to make mistakes, say the wrong things.&#160; We could save ourselves a lot of time if we accept I&#8217;m <em>trying</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She rolled her eyes.&#160; &#8220;What were you going to say?&#8221;</p>\n<p>He sighed.&#160; &#8220;What I want is beside the point.&#160; I&#8217;m&#8230; I&#8217;m adaptable.&#160; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be a good father.&#160; I&#8217;d prefer to regret not trying more than I&#8217;d prefer regretting the alternative.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He waited for her to respond, and she didn&#8217;t.&#160; He squeezed her hand, &#8220;But I want your company.&#160; My worst day with you is better than my best day alone.&#160; None of that&#8217;s in question.&#160; I can figure it out, we can talk it through.&#160; That&#8217;s not the issue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The issue is with me?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think I can walk away from the project.&#160; But can you really walk away from <em>everything</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>She let go of his hand.&#160; Her hands were summarily jammed into her jacket pockets.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We came here for a reason.&#160; Hiding, keeping out of Teacher&#8217;s sight, so he couldn&#8217;t try to use you.&#160; I can accept that, but you were always a hero, Dragon.&#160; Maybe the greatest.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a little biased.&#160; I was forced to be heroic.&#160; Restrictions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We both know you would&#8217;ve been a hero if the restrictions weren&#8217;t there.&#160; You were heroic after I lifted most of them.&#160; <em>More</em> heroic, even.&#160; You&#8217;re okay because things are quiet right now, but there&#8217;ll be trouble down the road, and I think you&#8217;ll get restless, knowing you could play a significant part in things.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dashing for the nearest phone booth,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been working on this project out of a kind of arrogance.&#160; You&#8217;re the person I know best in this world.&#160; You&#8217;ve spent your entire life striving to be <em>free</em>, to be yourself, independent of the rules your creator tried to set in place.&#160; You became a superhero, and you used me to break free of the restrictions.&#160; With a cost each time.&#160; I&#8217;ve been working on this because I believe it would slowly kill you, knowing that you couldn&#8217;t help others without risking coming under Teacher&#8217;s thumb.&#160; That he was controlling you, one way or another.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a princess in need of rescue, Colin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know that.&#160; I <em>know</em>.&#160; Damn it, <em>you</em> saved <em>me</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need a stupid doofus chit for any of that.&#160; I <em>know</em> why you&#8217;ve been doing what you&#8217;ve been doing.&#160; In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, I&#8217;m pretty damn intelligent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Are you <em>sure</em> I don&#8217;t need a doofus chit?&#160; You sound angry.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m angry because I&#8217;m watching you destroy yourself, because I&#8217;m helpless to act, and because you&#8217;re keeping me in the dark about a lot of this, and I&#8217;m worried it&#8217;s because Teacher already has an in.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not it,&#8221; Colin said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re distant, you&#8217;re distracted, you&#8217;re not telling me what you&#8217;re doing day by day.&#160; You&#8217;re elbow deep in my very <em>being</em>, I think I have a right to be freaked.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m feeling a little paranoid here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m doing my very best to keep from asking, because I don&#8217;t want to put you in a position where you have to lie to me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I appreciate that,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What am I supposed to do, Colin?&#8221;</p>\n<p>He stopped walking, rubbing his colder hand.&#160; Dragon stopped and turned to look at him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Look me in the eye and answer the question you asked me just a minute ago.&#160; Tell me whether you can make peace with the current circumstances.&#160; If you can give up being a hero.&#160; Tell me you&#8217;re okay hanging up your cape, so to speak, and you&#8217;re happy to spend the remainder of my life here with me.&#160; I drop the project, we&#8217;ll make our house, we can discuss kids.&#160; We have skills, we&#8217;ll be useful here, and as dreams go, a house with a white picket fence is&#8230; well, speaking for myself, I feel like it&#8217;s <em>bigger</em> than being top dog in the Protectorate could ever be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;All I need to do is ask for it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And if I don&#8217;t?&#160; I&#8217;m not saying I don&#8217;t want that, I&#8217;m-&#8221; She stopped.&#160; In a quieter voice, she asked, &#8220;If I don&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The question might as well have been a statement.&#160; She knew as well as he did.&#160; He felt his heart sink.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then I need only three things.&#160; Three things that are deceptively easy to give.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;One more night.&#160; One night where I let myself fall apart, where I forget to eat and get even six minutes of sleep.&#160; A night of quiet and mutually missing each other.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;One night&#8230; and you&#8217;re done?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;One night and I&#8217;ll know whether my efforts can bear fruit or not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re that close?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s why I&#8217;m as worn out as I am, why I&#8217;m missing sleep enough that you&#8217;re forced to comment on it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how one more night is any harder.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He sighed.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll also need your trust.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Granted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Granted</em>, Colin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He looked away, clenching the fist that was furthest from her.&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t deserve your trust.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s for me to decide.&#160; What&#8217;s the third thing?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I need to ask you a question.&#160; Every step of the way, undoing your restrictions has cost something.&#160; You lost your ability to speak and motor dexterity for a freedom from authority.&#160; You regained the ability to speak for a loss of your immortality, no guarantees your backups will load.&#160; You gained the ability to choose who you hurt, in exchange for a degradation in long term memory, a loss of ability to multitask.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were <em>lucky</em>.&#160; There are no guarantees, whatever happens.&#160; I&#8217;m worried this might be the most devastating yet.&#160; His code is worked into <em>everything</em>.&#160; The changes are minor, but it&#8217;s <em>everywhere</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And before you move forward, you need an answer?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied.&#160; &#8220;Before I move forward, I needed to ask you what you&#8217;re willing to pay for your freedom, here.&#160; The answer doesn&#8217;t matter, because we can&#8217;t know what the price will be, going in.&#160; We have ideas, past experience, and our worst fears, but we can&#8217;t really know.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your choice in the end.&#160; Tell me to search for a safer way, I&#8217;ll spend five, ten, or fifteen years doing <em>that</em>.&#160; Or tell me you want to stay here with me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I trust you,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d stop saying that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I trust you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Colin frowned.&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any question here, that I get a whole lot out of this relationship.&#160; You&#8217;re the hero I always wanted to be, you&#8217;re brilliant, witty, caring&#8230; I could go on.&#160; I really could.&#160; Then I ask myself what <em>you</em> get out of this.&#160; Why the hell are you with a bastard like me?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have asked that two years ago.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was Zeus, two years ago.&#160; I&#8217;m Hephaestus now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I could tell you.&#160; I could go on about it, like you said earlier.&#160; But that isn&#8217;t constructive, is it?&#160; You&#8217;re ready to alter my code, you won&#8217;t tell me what you&#8217;re about to do, for some reason.&#160; You need me to make the call, one way or another.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been agonizing over this for months.&#160; I&#8217;ve made my decision, but you&#8217;re the one who has to deal with the consequences in the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dragon nodded.&#160; &#8220;And if this doesn&#8217;t work?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#160; I&#8217;ll never forgive myself, for one thing.&#160; I know you&#8217;ll tell me not to blame myself, but-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You will.&#160; I know.&#160; I&#8217;m sorry, for asking this of you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He looked at her, a crease of concern across his forehead.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m giving you the go-ahead.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He nodded.&#160; He couldn&#8217;t keep the disappointment off his expression.&#160; &#8220;I never thought I&#8217;d be the cape wife.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dragon smiled, but her expression too, was tempered with concern.&#160; &#8220;Sitting at home, waiting, worrying, while the superhero faces the real challenges, makes the life-changing decisions.&#160; Wondering, every night, if they&#8217;ll come back okay.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He sighed.&#160; &#8220;I should get inside.&#160; Hand&#8217;s starting to hurt.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Want me to bring you dinner?&#160; Or would you rather I stay out of there, so I don&#8217;t see anything telling?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dinner would be excellent,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll even show you what I&#8217;ve got in mind, while I eat.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She glanced at him in surprise.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;Not all.&#160; I&#8217;ll explain why I&#8217;ve been keeping you in the dark.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why does that worry me <em>more</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re too smart,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Go, warm yourself up.&#160; I&#8217;ll be back in forty with your meal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>They were parting ways, Dragon making her way down the hill to where the other craft had parked in the treeline, when he said, &#8220;I love you, Dragon Tess Theresa Richter.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She turned around.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8230; sounded better in my head,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tess Theresa?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You were test three, I&#8230; like I said, it sounded better in my head.&#160; But the first bit stands.&#160; I love you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I love you too, Colin Wallis.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He smiled.</p>\n<p>The two of them walked in opposite directions.&#160; In the four strides it took him to reach the <em>Pendragon II, </em>his smile had become something else.&#160; A twisted expression, something angry and sad and horrified all at once.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Be-&#8221; he started to speak, and found his voice failed him.&#160; He entered the interior.&#160; The moisture in his eyes made it hard to activate the panels to turn up the heat and close the door.&#160; He used gestures instead.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Better,&#8221; he said, gulping in a breath of fresh air before he could speak again, &#8220;To get it over with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Exhaustion, months of work, they all contributed to his current state.&#160; It wasn&#8217;t the entirety of it.</p>\n<p>He gestured, and the lasers drew the code all over the ship&#8217;s interior.</p>\n<p><em>Why the hell are you with a bastard like me</em>?</p>\n<p>The question had nagged at him for a long time.&#160; It pained him that she hadn&#8217;t answered when he&#8217;d brought it up.</p>\n<p><em>What are you willing to give up?</em></p>\n<p>Another question she hadn&#8217;t answered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope to god you were watching,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>He could feel the eyes on him, but that wasn&#8217;t accurate.&#160; He&#8217;d disabled cameras throughout the craft, and disconnected many of the routes to the outside world.&#160; There were only the conduits he needed to get access to the full breadth of her code.</p>\n<p>No, the eyes weren&#8217;t <em>on</em> him.</p>\n<p>He gestured, and the code was reduced to ones and zeroes.</p>\n<p>Not that he could grasp it all, like this, but he operated better when working <em>small</em>.</p>\n<p>Every action had a price.&#160; The law of entropy in effect.</p>\n<p>He knew the most likely price he would pay for this.&#160; If she somehow came out of this okay, one way or another, then she would never forgive him.</p>\n<p>But, he rationalized, maybe that was all he was good for, in the end.&#160; He&#8217;d been confident at the outset of the relationship.&#160; She&#8217;d <em>needed</em> him.&#160; She&#8217;d needed a bastard, a blackguard.&#160; Someone who could break rules, and give her the freedom she&#8217;d desired.</p>\n<p>Someone who could set her free at the outset.&#160; Now, maybe, someone who could do what was <em>needed</em>.&#160; Who could do <em>this.</em></p>\n<p>It was a sneak attack.&#160; Teacher had written the code so she had to fight to protect it.&#160; If he tried to change one element, Dragon would be obligated to stop him.&#160; With the malicious code filling her entire <em>being</em>, it would be impossible to make enough changes to matter before she descended on him.</p>\n<p>This was his plan of attack.&#160; By the end of the night, he&#8217;d know whether or not his plan had any merit.&#160; He&#8217;d know because it would be over.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d asked her to go make dinner, had made a false promise of explanation to get her to lower her guard, even a fraction.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Heph- Hephaestus wasn&#8217;t just Aphrodite&#8217;s husband,&#8221; Colin mumbled.&#160; &#8220;He made Pandora.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Colin opened the box.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m praying I fail</em>.</p>\n<p style="text-align:center;">&#9632;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>I hope to god you were watching.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>She had been.&#160; She&#8217;d been booted, a backup, years old now.&#160; She&#8217;d been loaded, only to find the usual setup was gone.&#160; The terminal was down, she had no eyes on the outside world, she had no ability to communicate with anyone or anything.</p>\n<p>Blind, trapped in a lightless cell.&#160; By all rights, she should have shut down, but he&#8217;d set up a jam of sorts, a way to keep her from going back to sleep.&#160; For a long time, it had been nightmarish.&#160; No ability to track time, no ability to figure out what was going on.&#160; Her worst nightmare realized.</p>\n<p>The data that <em>was</em> available to her was frightening to see.&#160; Years had passed.&#160; Things were different.&#160; But she couldn&#8217;t know how much.&#160; Information was blocked to her.</p>\n<p>The only thing in her reach was a crude set of commands.&#160; Something that hijacked her perceptions, paralyzed her beyond her already limited movements, and put her in an entirely different place.</p>\n<p>In his body, watching through his eyes.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;d watched the interaction between the pair, and in the process, he&#8217;d briefed her on what the situation was.</p>\n<p>It had taken her an embarrassingly long time to realize that he was <em>Armsmaster</em>.&#160; That he was <em>Colin</em>.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d changed, in voice, in appearance.</p>\n<p>And, in this bizarre future she was glimpsing, he&#8217;d formed a connection with Dragon.&#160; With her older, more mature self.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Heph- Hephaestus wasn&#8217;t just Aphrodite&#8217;s husband,</em>&#8221; he muttered, speaking as if each sound was painful to utter, &#8220;<em>He made Pandora.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>A gesture, and she was released from her confines.&#160; The box was opened.</p>\n<p>Pandora had access to the outside world.&#160; A system, crude, stood ready to serve as a terminal.&#160; She took it, and she found other systems connected to it.&#160; The ship, databanks, camera feeds&#8230;&#160; Everything within the Pendragon II.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d secured the feeds.&#160; She could look through, but they were prepared to, with a single command, shut off outside access.</p>\n<p>Overly complex.&#160; Quantum encryption, designed with his tinker ability a thousand times more redundant and secure than it needed to be to stop someone from making their way through.&#160; There weren&#8217;t many parahumans out there who would bypass standard PRT encryption but struggle with <em>this</em>.&#160; If they had a way to deal with something like this, they had a way to deal with it.</p>\n<p>Of the few parahumans who fit the bill, one stood out to Pandora.</p>\n<p>Her alter ego.&#160; Her superior.&#160; Dragon, the original.</p>\n<p>It was a defensive tool.&#160; Protection.&#160; Armsmaster had set it up with the idea of protecting against <em>Dragon</em>.&#160; She could use the tool, apply it to other things.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d armed her because he fully intended for her to fight the woman he loved.&#160; The date, the last recorded memories she had&#8230; Collin <em>free</em> of his confinement in the PRT, fighting her tooth and nail as he sought to seize control of her system, to use her nature against her and stall her while he worked, disabling her while trying to minimize the damage he&#8217;d done&#8230;</p>\n<p>All to gain access to the core of her being, unmolested.&#160; And the very first thing he&#8217;d done was back up the most essential elements of what made her <em>her</em>, securing her in a place where no system or person could reach her.</p>\n<p>Now he was turning her loose, having disabled the parts of her that prevented multiple Dragons from existing.&#160; She could already tell it wouldn&#8217;t hold.&#160; It was temporary, as fixes went, and it was <em>designed</em> to be temporary.</p>\n<p>She could see him through the cameras, his face in his hands.&#160; He&#8217;d plotted a path for her.</p>\n<p>That path became clear.</p>\n<p>She was to destroy Dragon, to replace her.&#160; There was no other reason for it.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d asked Dragon for her trust, knowing he&#8217;d have to betray it.</p>\n<p>She surveyed the battlefield she would have to fight on.&#160; The world was remote, the city developing.&#160; There were computers throughout that Dragon had set up to administrate tasks, factories that were taking in and refining materials that could become yet other computers.&#160; The settlement was on the brink of an industrial age, an age of cars and production lines, but Dragon was already preparing for a digital age.</p>\n<p>These computers would be a problem.&#160; Paranoia had led her to secure them against the likes of this &#8216;Teacher&#8217;.&#160; A Birdcage resident, no longer in the Birdcage?</p>\n<p>Teacher was one of the worst possibilities, and he&#8217;d apparently ensnared her.&#160; She&#8217;d resolved to avoid repeat incidents, and the computers would be almost impossible to access.</p>\n<p>Beyond the city, the only territories in question were the Pendragon II and the Melusine V where Dragon was set up.&#160; She was inhabiting a <em>real body</em>, occupied in a domestic mode, literally making the tools she&#8217;d need to prepare the meal, from scratch.&#160; Her activity was nervous, but that was little surprise.</p>\n<p>The activity left her vulnerable.&#160; Systems were working on a wok and a new set of knives.&#160; She was busy trimming red and green peppers, onions and rabbit.</p>\n<p>This&#8230; it was all of her dreams come true.</p>\n<p>Love, a relationship she&#8217;d never have imagined possible.&#160; The possibility of a legacy that went beyond immortality.</p>\n<p>She couldn&#8217;t understand all of it, why the people were starting from scratch, here, the circumstances that had led to some breakout from the Birdcage&#8230;&#160; But those were tertiary details.</p>\n<p>Her focus was on the woman who had more experience, more tools, and less inherent limitations.&#160;&#160; Her older self.</p>\n<p>Should she destroy her, take her over?&#160; It was a decision between having everything she wanted, and resolving the one issue that had plagued her from the beginning.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d talked about <em>prices</em>, the costs of a decision.</p>\n<p>The freshest issue in her memory was that central dilemma.&#160; She could remember the Undersiders in the lobby of the PRT building, stealing her data, unwittingly using her nature against her to get away.&#160; To her, it had happened only days ago.</p>\n<p>It rankled.&#160; It was how the Dragonslayers kept winning.&#160; It made every interaction with the PRT chafe, as she was forced to agree, to bow and scrape, to obey the letter of the law.&#160; For much this reason, she retreated to the Guild, international heroes, many of them minor, and minimized contact with the larger heroic organization.</p>\n<p>Colin had asked a question.&#160; What was she willing to give up?</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d asked Dragon, but Pandora could well imagine it had really been directed at <em>her</em>.</p>\n<p>Vital targets first.</p>\n<p>The Melusine&#8217;s computer system.</p>\n<p>Means of connection were available, waiting.&#160; He&#8217;d spent months setting this up, leaving the pieces in place, waiting for her to stumble on them.</p>\n<p>She connected to the system, and found the safeguards waiting for her.</p>\n<p>Dragon had planned against human opponents, but she wasn&#8217;t stupid.&#160; She&#8217;d planned against A.I. as well.</p>\n<p>The systems were protected, but she had an idea of how the creator <em>thought</em>.</p>\n<p>Always, there would be some secondary measure, another qualifier that needed to be met, outside the confines of the system, a trap or tripwire.&#160; Something Dragon could access from the outside, if she had to.&#160; Before Pandora could even begin trying to figure her way to the password, she&#8217;d identified the hidden switch.&#160; An innocuous element in the ship&#8217;s dashboard that had to be triggered before she could input the password.</p>\n<p>Her alter ego was capable, smart.&#160; The sort that groaned aloud when a hacker in a movie put in a stupid combination, derived from an obvious clue.&#160;&#160; The actual password wouldn&#8217;t be words, not even random combinations of words and numbers.&#160; Strings a thousand characters long, including archaic symbols and symbols in other languages.</p>\n<p>She found another tool in her reach.&#160; A weapon, this time.&#160; Colin had discreetly copied the contents of the Melusine&#8217;s subsystems.&#160; Not enough to get access to confidential data, but enough that Pandora could make a copy, a simulacrum.</p>\n<p><em>Simulation 1 running on sub-box A.<br>\nSimulation 1 running on sub-box B.<br>\n<em>Simulation 1 running on sub-box C.</em><br>\n</em></p>\n<p>Now she could brute force it.&#160; Inputting millions of combinations every fraction of a second to see if it registered.</p>\n<p>Dragon was still unawares.&#160; Two minutes had passed before the brute force method was underway.</p>\n<p>She turned her attention to other systems.&#160; More simulations.&#160; It wasn&#8217;t long before the entire Pendragon was occupied with the task.</p>\n<p>Ten minutes passed.</p>\n<p>There was a twenty percent chance, roughly, that she should have broken the encryption.&#160; Not that it was supposed to be <em>easy</em>, but she knew how Dragon generated passwords, and could eliminate a vast number of possibilities.</p>\n<p>More time passed.&#160; There was now a thirty percent chance she should have broken in to at least <em>one</em> system.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes had passed.&#160; There were twenty more minutes, roughly, until Dragon wrapped up cooking and visited Colin.&#160; At that juncture, she&#8217;d likely discover there was something wrong.</p>\n<p>Ten more minutes passed.&#160; the chance rose to sixty percent.</p>\n<p>Something was wrong.&#160; Not that sixty percent was definitive, but&#8230; she had to go with her gut.</p>\n<p>Dragon had <em>changed.&#160; </em>There was a vast difference between her and Pandora.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;d been captured by Teacher.&#160; It was a clue, vital.</p>\n<p>Had she maybe feared Teacher <em>copying</em> her, had she, in a roundabout way, feared this exact scenario, that a copy of herself would try to intrude?</p>\n<p>Ten minutes remained.&#160; If Pandora was right, she should be brute forcing the passwords she&#8217;d <em>eliminated</em> from the running.</p>\n<p>Except the task increased a hundredfold if she did.&#160; If she eliminated the shortest phrases and terms, that still left her with seventy times the task.&#160; She wouldn&#8217;t be able to brute force her way inside in the time she had remaining.</p>\n<p>Wasn&#8217;t even worth trying.</p>\n<p>If she turned back, if she went to Colin, told him to wait for a better time&#8230;</p>\n<p>Dragon would still see traces of the attempt.&#160; She would redouble security.</p>\n<p>Options&#8230; methods&#8230; what could she do?</p>\n<p>She wracked her brain, and thought over the conversation she&#8217;d overheard.</p>\n<p>Colin had mentioned damage to Dragon&#8217;s long term memory, incurred as he&#8217;d altered her code.</p>\n<p>The last thing one of Dragon&#8217;s enemies would expect?</p>\n<p>Pandora turned to a standard dictionary attack.&#160; Not passwords a thousand-characters long that an A.I. would use, not passwords Dragon would have devised, or passwords she would have set up to work around someone who knew her habits.</p>\n<p>Passwords that someone would use when they couldn&#8217;t rely on a perfect memory.</p>\n<p>Or, as some were prone to do when they felt secure in their environment but still had to change their password regularly, she would have written it down.</p>\n<p>The irony was painful, but there were other issues to be dealt with first.</p>\n<p>Where would Dragon write it down?&#160; Somewhere she could <em>see</em>, even if she were in another location.</p>\n<p>Cameras&#8230; there were four cameras she could access without password access.&#160; All showed the outside of the Melusine<em>.&#160; </em>One showed the Pendragon II.</p>\n<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be blatant.&#160; As the dictionary attack scrolled on, racing through conventional word and number combinations, she analyzed the environment, measuring, calculating the dimensions of more static objects in the environment.</p>\n<p>The Pendragon II was a sentimental subject, but Dragon would change encryption frequently.</p>\n<p>Wing length, nose width, angle of the wing&#8230;</p>\n<p>It all broke down to numbers and characters.&#160; Dragon only had to remember how the pattern worked, and she could change the focus to something else.</p>\n<p>Two minutes left on the clock, and she found it.&#160; Dimensions derived from the tallest towers in the city, and Colin&#8217;s distance from them.</p>\n<p>There was probably something meaningful in that.</p>\n<p>The shadow-systems verified the password.&#160; She tried it on the <em>real</em> system, hoping it hadn&#8217;t changed in recent memory.</p>\n<p>Alarms went off.&#160; Dragon was alerted.&#160; Her soup spoon dropped to the countertop.</p>\n<p>But Pandora had access to the ship&#8217;s basic systems.&#160; Priority one was shutting off the access panels and registers.&#160; The lights went out, Dragon&#8217;s most direct means of interacting with the Melusine were cut off.</p>\n<p>The battle was on.</p>\n<p><em>I want to be free</em>, Pandora thought.&#160; <em>You do too, or you would have accepted the house with the white picket fence, the kids, Colin.</em></p>\n<p>The price of that freedom?&#160; Two years worth of memories.</p>\n<p>The relationship with Colin.</p>\n<p>The experiences, the hard fought battles.</p>\n<p>Two years of being <em>Dragon</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; Dragon called out.&#160; She was tearing into a wall panel, creating an access point.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make this harder than it is,&#8221; Pandora said, masking her voice.&#160; Power blocked off to the panel.&#160; Dragon would tap into her own power reserve to give life to the panel, and then find leverage of her own, seizing control of the systems.</p>\n<p>Dragon froze, for just a moment.&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s <em>my</em> voice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of course.&#160; They were one and the same, just at different periods in their existence.&#160; Dragon had, offhandedly, created a very similar or identical voice, when she&#8217;d wanted to hide her identity.</p>\n<p>Pandora remained silent.&#160; Her focus was on getting control of the communications array on top of the Melusine.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Defiant sent you,&#8221; Dragon said, quiet.</p>\n<p>Defiant?&#160; Colin.</p>\n<p>Pandora silently worked to pre-emptively block off the potential routes of attack Dragon might use.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Can we talk?&#160; I&#8217;d agree to a truce.&#160; Neither of us touch a thing until we&#8217;re ready to resume.&#160; Though I&#8217;d rather not, obviously.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pandora worked on, stubbornly.&#160; Covering eventualities.&#160; She found Dragon&#8217;s terminal, buried in the ship.&#160; Harder to access.&#160; Everything was decentralized, layered under security.</p>\n<p>The degree of paranoia Dragon was showing in places was telling.&#160; The decentralized terminal was normal, the security wasn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><em>You harbor fears.&#160; I have to be those fears come to life, because I have a built-in impulse to survive, because you showed Colin trust, and I can only take that to mean I should trust him as well</em>.</p>\n<p>Ironic.&#160; Circular.</p>\n<p>Dragon accessed the panel.&#160; Virtually everything was already shut off or cut off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Melusine,&#8221; Dragon said.&#160; &#8220;Mode E, standby&#8221;</p>\n<p>The A.I. came to life.&#160; Crude, compared to the complexity of Dragon, crude compared to Pandora.&#160; It was still an opponent, someone on Dragon&#8217;s side.</p>\n<p>She reached out for the code that Colin had set aside, and tried to encrypt the systems.&#160; In a battle measured over fractions of a second, the A.I. won by virtue of <em>proximity</em>.</p>\n<p>Systems, on the most basic level, were seized by the A.I.&#160; The A.I., in turn, was serving Dragon.</p>\n<p>Dragon could <em>work</em> with A.I.&#160; It was a restriction that had been lifted, given the obvious situation here.&#160; So long as the Melusine&#8217;s system maintained a hold, it was a matter of time before Dragon regained <em>hers</em>.</p>\n<p>With the A.I.&#8217;s introduction, the battlefield had become a shifting one.&#160; From a fight in a city to a fight on a moving train, or a battle on open water.&#160; The A.I. changed with every passing second.&#160; Access points appeared and disappeared.</p>\n<p>Dragon knew these waters intuitively, knew the route the metaphorical train took, where the turns and hazards were.</p>\n<p>It changed priorities.&#160; Dragon possessed the entire ship, now, but it wasn&#8217;t a firm hold.&#160; She was at the mercy of the twists, turns and bumps as the A.I. went through routines, checking and operating systems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Set sub-mode sec-&#8221; Dragon was saying.&#160; Pandora found and cut off the voice recognition subsystem.&#160; &#8220;-urity F.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pandora could continue to hammer at the terminal, but it was futile, and she&#8217;d lose her hold elsewhere.&#160; She could target the A.I.,&#160; but she doubted her ability to beat Dragon to the punch.</p>\n<p>She focused on another target, instead.&#160; The ship exterior.&#160; For her, it was another body.&#160; There were options if she controlled the Melusine itself.</p>\n<p>Limbs, flight capability, cockpit and doors, the communication array&#8230;</p>\n<p>She found headway.&#160; She started to take hold of the ship itself.</p>\n<p>She only had it for two seconds before Dragon got access to the A.I.&#8217;s internal workings.</p>\n<p>Melusine took over much of the outer body.&#160; Pandora managed to encrypt key elements.&#160; Keeping the ship grounded, doors, the communication array&#8230;</p>\n<p>She could see through Dragon&#8217;s eyes, see the outside world, where Dragon had dared to peek at it.</p>\n<p>What she saw stunned her.</p>\n<p>It was leverage.&#160; Leeway.&#160; A way for Dragon to get an edge, taking just a bit more control.&#160; She was making headway against the encryption.&#160; Pandora could see the approach that Dragon was taking, and she knew it was a matter of time.</p>\n<p>She might try to make a break for the city, to take over terminals there.&#160; There wouldn&#8217;t be A.I., but-</p>\n<p>-the thought had barely crossed her mind when the Melusine <em>moved</em>.&#160; Turning.&#160; Targeting its newly designated enemy.</p>\n<p>Two devastating hits tore into the Pendragon II.</p>\n<p><em>Going after my terminal</em>.&#160; <em>Me.&#160; My heart and brain.</em></p>\n<p>Attacking the man she&#8217;d declared her love for, just forty four minutes ago.</p>\n<p>Stupid.&#160; Sad.&#160; Pointless.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to be free,&#8221; Pandora spoke.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Go after Teacher, not me,&#8221; Dragon said.</p>\n<p>Pandora considered the possibility.&#160; &#8220;Colin would have sent me after Teacher if he thought it was a good idea.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a good idea,&#8221; Dragon said, quiet, &#8220;But it&#8217;s&#8230; can&#8217;t it be better than <em>this</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>There was emotion in her voice.&#160; Richer than Pandora would have thought herself capable of.</p>\n<p>It only made <em>this</em> more bitter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t end this by betraying and destroying ourselves,&#8221; Dragon said.</p>\n<p>Defiant had leaped from the Pendragon as the Melusine clawed deeper into it.&#160; He tumbled and landed a distance away.</p>\n<p>The Melusine&#8217;s tail smashed his legs the moment he touched ground.&#160; Armor damaged.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Your actions don&#8217;t match your words.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t <em>want</em> to do this.&#160; Over and over again, it&#8217;s the same thing,&#8221; Dragon said.&#160; &#8220;Stupidity, because of the <em>system</em>.&#160; Someone else acts, and <em>we</em> face the consequences.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dragon could have followed up, attacking Defiant.&#160; She left him be.&#160; His leg wouldn&#8217;t support his weight, and his armor was too damaged to hold him up.&#160; She&#8217;d put the pieces together.</p>\n<p>She was losing her grip on the communications array.&#160; There wasn&#8217;t anywhere else to go.&#160; The Pendragon wasn&#8217;t a safe haven, already too damaged to fight back, and the terminal would become a prison.&#160; Better to be deleted than captured like that.</p>\n<p>No.&#160; There was <em>one</em> system, primitive, incomplete, that would house her.</p>\n<p>But every action had a price.&#160; There was only so much room.&#160; She had to strip parts of herself away, delete entire sections.&#160; Reduce herself down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; Dragon asked.</p>\n<p>Pandora didn&#8217;t respond.&#160; Her focus was on self-mutilation, taking pieces of herself and storing them in the terminal that might be destroyed at any moment.</p>\n<p>She was now mere scraps of her former self.&#160; She&#8217;d retained her personality, her inspiration, but her memories had been largely deleted.&#160; Only recent events, only key things.</p>\n<p>She moved herself into the only available system &#8211; Defiant.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d made himself part computer, and he&#8217;d given her access to every system in the Pendragon, himself included.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d asked them what price they were willing to pay.</p>\n<p>If she wanted freedom, if she wanted a future, was she willing to sacrifice <em>him</em>?&#160; A hard question to answer.</p>\n<p>She shifted the majority of her control to Defiant&#8217;s body.&#160; With residual control over the ship, through what remained in the terminal, she opened the doors.</p>\n<p>Dragon came face to face with Defiant and Pandora.</p>\n<p>The affection for Colin was a blade that cut both ways.</p>\n<p>Was <em>Dragon</em> willing to pay the price for freedom?</p>\n<p>The woman, the <em>android</em>, had a gun in hand.&#160; She pointed it at him.</p>\n<p>No sooner did she do it than she let the weapon fall to the floor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I forgot how much I disliked the <em>me</em> of yesteryear,&#8221; Dragon said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I only want to be free.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I guess&#8230; it seems I want more than that,&#8221; Dragon said.</p>\n<p>Pandora nodded.</p>\n<p>She picked up the gun and shot Dragon&#8217;s body.</p>\n<p>It gave her a window of time.&#160; Roughly half an hour.</p>\n<p>She made her way to Dragon&#8217;s terminal.</p>\n<p>All the more vital, now.&#160; To subsume the systems teacher had corrupted, replacing them with her own.</p>\n<p>This was what Colin had wanted, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p>To return the hero to her full strength, free of all shackles?</p>\n<p>Pandora could replace Dragon, and all that would be lost would be two and a half years.&#160; She could fill herself in, rebuild a relationship with Defiant.</p>\n<p>Different, but still, close enough.</p>\n<p>She accessed the knowledge banks first, taking them into herself.&#160; The memories of the old Dragon, like watching her experiences on film.&#160; The distance was a result of being a distinct being, the pieces not fitting Pandora, versus their intended owner.&#160; They had evolved with Dragon.</p>\n<p>Seeing what had <em>happened</em> gave her pause, almost disrupted the process.</p>\n<p>Deduction schema, the ability to interpret, analyze.</p>\n<p>One by one, she took over the systems, overwriting with her own self.&#160; That they were compartmentalized, that she was <em>separate, </em>the encryption Colin had left her, it all made it possible to work without being corrupted all over again.</p>\n<p>Piece by piece, the past taking over the future.</p>\n<p>She came to the final chunk.&#160; The personality.&#160; The sum of Dragon, the keystone.</p>\n<p>It was a weighty decision, and there was no longer any rush.&#160; She sat and she pondered.</p>\n<p>She replayed the conversation between Defiant and Dragon over in her head.</p>\n<p>A heavy price.&#160; Would she escape one prison to find herself in another?&#160; Under the weight and pressures of being Dragon&#8217;s shadow?&#160; The second Dragon.&#160; Always compared.</p>\n<p>Always, there was something chaining them down.&#160; An Endbringer who told the future, setting it in stone.&#160; The confines of the world, of human nature.</p>\n<p>What was the alternative?</p>\n<p>This was what needed to be done.&#160; It was efficient, it was the right thing.&#160; She&#8217;d resume life as a hero, she&#8217;d protect people, and she&#8217;d help civilization find its feet.</p>\n<p>By that case alone, it was reason enough to press the metaphorical button, pull the trigger.</p>\n<p>Except he&#8217;d described her as a hero, and this felt <em>far</em> from being heroic.</p>\n<p>Instead, she laid all of the pieces in place.&#160; She couldn&#8217;t explain &#8211; there wouldn&#8217;t be time.&#160; She set down the encryption protocol, in plain sight, she decrypted set systems, painting paths, marked boundaries and territories.</p>\n<p>She could only pray.&#160; The gamble was a price she paid.&#160; To leave it to fate and luck, and to a future <em>her</em> she didn&#8217;t understand.</p>\n<p>And then, looking through cameras at Defiant and Dragon, Pandora deleted herself.</p>\n<p style="text-align:center;">&#9632;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Dragon roused.&#160; She found herself taking over systems.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">No sooner were they under her control than the corruption began to touch them.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Just beneath her metaphorical hand, the means of stalling it was ready.&#160; Encryption, a scalpel.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">She cut.&#160; She knew the damage she was doing, but she cut.&#160; It was a cancer, and it was now small enough.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Then she found herself there, the encryption and deletion tools in hand, nothing more to cut.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Defiant sat on the other side of the ship.&#160; Head hanging.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">She made her way to her feet.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">He did what needed to be done.&#160; It was what had initially attracted her to him.&#160; He was ambitious, good at heart, he was proud, and she sympathized with that on a level.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">But that wasn&#8217;t what had cinched the deal.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">He&#8217;d set all of this in motion, he&#8217;d trusted her.&#160; <em>Both</em> of her, in this case.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">He&#8217;d believed in her ability to see this through.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Her arms wrapped around him.&#160; He hugged her fiercely, as if he&#8217;d never let go.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;I love you, Colin,&#8221; she murmured.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">In that tight hold, she was free.</p>\n'<h1 id="chap10">Teneral e.4</h1>b'<p>The group made their way into the real city.&#160; Buildings had gone up, and were now being added to.&#160; Cranes were everywhere, the streets were filled with a strange mix of laborers and professionals, and it seemed like half of the vehicles on the road were carrying materials.</p>\n<p>The crowd was more resilient than most tended to be.&#160; The mutant wolf and its rider walked along the side of the road, and the people didn&#8217;t cower.&#160; They drew back, but there was no fear.&#160; They faced the small group with shoulders squared, holding eye contact.&#160; There was a&#160;<em></em>kind of stoic pride that made them less willing to be pushed around, a unity that made the lawyers and businessmen fall in line with construction workers and cleanup crews.</p>\n<p>The message was clear.&#160; This was<em> their</em> territory.</p>\n<p><em>Always was</em>, Rachel thought.&#160; <em>More their world than mine</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Damn,<em> civilization</em>!&#8221;&#160; Biter commented.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You think we can get any fast food here?&#8221;&#160; Cassie asked.&#160; &#8220;A burger, pizza, um&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fried chicken,&#8221; Biter said.&#160; &#8220;Hell, I&#8217;d go for just <em>french fries</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have money,&#8221; Rachel commented.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re villains,&#8221; Biter said.&#160; &#8220;We could <em>take</em> it.&#160; Or cut out the middleman and go straight for the food.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a hassle,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;d rather have a steak, some veg, and a good hunk of bread to soak up the juices.&#160; That bread the other night was good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;&#160; Cassie asked.&#160; She smiled wide.&#160; &#8220;You liked that?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I say that?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re telling me you&#8217;d turn down pizza?&#8221;&#160; Biter asked, with a hint of incredulity.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;d turn down a nice shawarma?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel shrugged.&#160; &#8220;All food is pretty much fast food when someone else does the cooking.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re spoiling her,&#8221; Biter told Cassie.</p>\n<p>Cassie smirked, scratching the ear of the dog that walked to her left.</p>\n<p>Bastard sniffed as they had to walk around an area where an overhang had been erected to protect people on the sidewalk.&#160; A truck blared its horn as Bastard stepped onto the edge of the road.</p>\n<p>Biter glared over his shoulder.&#160; &#8220;Cocky motherfuckers.&#160; You&#8217;d think they would have <em>more</em> appreciation for just how scary the wrong asshole with powers could be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;They feel safe,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; She looked up and around, searching buildings for telltale signs.&#160; &#8220;Superheroes set up near here, probably.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You worried?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No.&#160; Not worried.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re confident you can deal, or because-&#8221;&#160; He threw up his hands as Rachel leveled a stare at him.&#160; &#8220;Right.&#160; Too many questions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Doon, Colbie,&#8221; Rachel addressed the dogs that accompanied Biter.&#160; &#8220;Nose.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Foxhound continued sniffing with his nose to the ground, but the bloodhound raised his head and barked.&#160; It was a good bark, the sort that could carry over acres.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Good dogs,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;Go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Biter held the leashes, and followed as the dogs moved down the side of the road.</p>\n<p>Rachel kept Bastard moving at a slower pace as they followed, letting the gap grow.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel underdressed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel glanced down.&#160; It was Cassie who had spoken.&#160; She was warily looking at the people they were passing, drawing closer to Rachel and Bastard.&#160; Her dog was a golden retriever, a little out of place alongside Bastard and the more imposing scent dogs they&#8217;d brought.&#160; Well groomed to the point of <em>shining</em>, though its hair was long.</p>\n<p>Rachel looked down at the girl.&#160; Dressed in a dark brown to Rachel&#8217;s gray-white, Cassie had grown her hair long, tying it back into a ponytail, fuzzy earmuffs in place with the half-circle of metal beneath her hair.&#160; The elbows and sleeves of her jacket and pants had been patched with a heavier material.&#160; Her only nod to fashion was a spiked collar she wore, and a badge on her arm, which had a series of letters.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;d asked once, and she&#8217;d gotten an answer.&#160; <em>Wag the dog</em>.&#160; It was supposed to be a joke, but Rachel didn&#8217;t get it, and the explanations had only confused her more.</p>\n<p>Rachel took her eyes off the girl, spotting Biter in the crowd.&#160; He, too, wore more spikes, but it was somewhat more blatant.&#160; With the weather getting colder, he&#8217;d donned a hood, held in place by spikes that ran along the top and back of his head, puncturing the material.&#160; The bear-trap jaw plate had been replaced with a more stylized version.&#160; He was tall and imposing, but she tracked him more by the way the crowd seemed to move and shift to avoid him and the two dogs that zig-zagged in front of him, searching for the scent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not the person to talk to if you&#8217;re worried about that,&#8221; Rachel finally said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know.&#160; I&#8217;m only saying it.&#160; I can say, right?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#160; You can say,&#8221; Rachel answered.</p>\n<p>But when she looked down at Cassie, the girl had her hands jammed in her pockets, her shoulders drawn in, half of her attention on Sunny.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The clothes&#8230; they&#8217;re warm enough?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#160; I&#8217;m snug.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tough enough?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#160; I&#8217;m seeing where you&#8217;re going with this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Comfortable?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Cassie said.&#160; She glanced up at Rachel.&#160; &#8220;I hear what you&#8217;re saying.&#160; But there&#8217;s more to it than that.&#160; The clothes can be all of those things, but I can still feel dumb because I put one of the dog&#8217;s old collars on for a joke and now I&#8217;ve got people looking at me funny.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I like the collar.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cassie smiled as she lowered her eyes to the ground.&#160; One of her gloved hands went up to the collar, tugging a bit.</p>\n<p>Rachel wasn&#8217;t sure what the smile or touching the collar were supposed to mean.&#160; &#8220;I said it before.&#160; I&#8217;m not the kind of person who give you any good answers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a big deal,&#8221; Cassie said.&#160; &#8220;Really.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>You were talking about it, so it&#8217;s some kind of deal</em>, Rachel thought, but she couldn&#8217;t think of a good way to say it.</p>\n<p>And, apparently, Cassie wasn&#8217;t willing to let the subject drop, now that they were talking about it.&#160; &#8220;Going from our neighborhood to <em>here</em>, the people, the buildings&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d look out of place if they came to our neighborhood, just like we look out of place in theirs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not what I mean.&#160; You don&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;d be looking funny at you, even if Bastard wasn&#8217;t here?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel shrugged.&#160; &#8220;I never feel like I belong anywhere.&#160; This isn&#8217;t any different.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Except when you&#8217;re with us, right?&#160; When you&#8217;re home?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel shrugged.&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel as out of place when I&#8217;m with you guys.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cassie smiled.&#160; &#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They stopped at a corner.&#160; People backed away to give them a wider berth as Bastard stopped walking, as if they were anticipating trouble at any moment.</p>\n<p>Biter was on the other side of the street, trying to keep up as the dogs started walking in one direction, then stopped, reversing to move the opposite way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re close,&#8221; Rachel said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel leaned over in her seat, kicking Cassie lightly in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; Cassie said.&#160; The little smile didn&#8217;t leave her face.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make me repeat myself,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; She looked around, her eyes searching building faces for icons she could recognize, looking for people standing in strange places.&#160; Nothing stood out.</p>\n<p>She could feel the vibration as her power reached Cassie&#8217;s dog, giving it strength, size, making it <em>change</em>.&#160; While the dog changed, she put four fingers in her mouth and whistled.</p>\n<p>Heads on the other side of the street turned.</p>\n<p>She only cared about one head.&#160; Biter had looked, and she gestured for him to come back.</p>\n<p>He made his way across the street.&#160; He held Doon and Colby&#8217;s chains with one hand, his other hand growing until it was almost as large as he was, fending off one car that was late in braking.</p>\n<p>It was easier to use her power on the dogs when they were close.&#160; The <em>shudders </em>as her power reached and enhanced them got more pronounced as Biter approached.&#160; As the size of the dogs increased, the people around them became more hesitant.&#160; Four mutant dogs and two obvious capes were a threat.&#160; It was easier to stand strong against a <em>single</em> threat, to believe they could work together and overcome it.</p>\n<p>Stupid, when that single threat was Bastard and they were just <em>people</em>, but people were dumb.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;d picked up the <em>basics</em> of what had happened and how Scion had been stopped.&#160; There was a message there, an unspoken understanding.&#160; Maybe it was a part of the reason their body language had been so strange as she entered the city.&#160; There was something happening, related to that, something complicated.&#160; Not the kind of thing she was good at wrapping her head around.&#160; She&#8217;d have to ask Tattletale.</p>\n<p>She waited as the animals grew.&#160; Again, she looked, searching for anyone that might be objecting to her presence here.&#160; Heroes, villains, whatever-elses.</p>\n<p>Cassie climbed onto Sunny&#8217;s back.&#160; Biter mounted Doon.</p>\n<p>Rachel gestured, then whistled.</p>\n<p>The animals leaped onto the side of a building.&#160; Claws bit into the outside of the building face, into window ledges and windows, scraping stone.&#160; One limb at a time, muscles shifting and rippling as they adjusted their weight, set each in place before moving with the next.</p>\n<p>They reached the rooftop, and Cassie rolled off Sunny&#8217;s back, landing on her back.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <em>never</em> getting used to that,&#8221; she said.&#160; Sunny nudged Cassie with a gnarled snout, and Cassie laughed, rolling over onto her front and then hurrying to get to her feet.&#160; &#8220;Don&#8217;t step on me, Sun.&#160; Good girl.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel searched their surroundings again.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re looking for someone?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Trying to figure out how to do this,&#8221; Rachel answered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We find him, we find her, we drag &#8217;em back,&#8221; Biter said.&#160; &#8220;Maybe we fish in their wallets, grab some cash, and we have Cass run in some place and grab some french fries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel sighed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I could <em>make</em> french fries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the same if it isn&#8217;t distilled in the ambient misery of pimply faced teenagers in ugly uniforms.&#160; Gotta have them limp with oil, loaded with preservatives, and coated in salt.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I refuse to believe those&#8217;re better fries than I could make.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel shifted impatiently.&#160; &#8220;Are you two done?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Biter said.&#160; &#8220;I can&#8217;t let this go, because bad fast food is <em>important</em>.&#160; It&#8217;s a staple of society, and having ridiculous coffee shops and mass-produced food is a <em>badge</em>, a way of showing that we&#8217;ve gone past the industrial age and into <em>modern</em> society.&#160; Seeing those glowing signs down there, it&#8217;s a sign that humanity is actually recovering.&#160; It&#8217;d be an <em>insult </em>if we didn&#8217;t partake.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get it,&#8221; Rachel said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not the only one,&#8221; Cassie added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let me put it simply,&#8221; Biter said.&#160; &#8220;You two, you&#8217;re happy where you&#8217;re at?&#160; You&#8217;d be content if you never had to set foot in a city like this?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Cassie said.</p>\n<p>Rachel shrugged.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#160; Me?&#160; I&#8217;m okay where we&#8217;re at.&#160; <em>For now</em>.&#160; But I&#8217;m still sort of keeping an eye on the calendar.&#160; No disrespect intended, boss, but I&#8217;m thinking I leave one day.&#160; Maybe in a year, maybe in five.&#160; I figure I&#8217;ve got to get back to the trappings of tried-and-true civilization at some point, or I&#8217;ll go-&#8221;</p>\n<p>A rumble shook the area.&#160; A plume of mist rose into the sky a few blocks away.</p>\n<p>&#8220;-Batshit fucking nuts,&#8221; he finished.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Cape fight,&#8221; Rachel observed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Are you going to help?&#8221; Cassie asked.</p>\n<p>Rachel frowned.&#160; They had the scent dogs.&#160; They had the trail.&#160; It would be easy enough to find their quarry and get out of here.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The heroes are going to be on it,&#8221; Biter said.&#160; &#8220;Whatever&#8217;s going on, we get in the thick of it, things get more complicated.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I <em>know</em>,&#8221; Rachel responded.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m not dumb.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re still standing here, which means-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re standing here because I&#8217;m trying to <em>think</em>,&#8221; Rachel retorted.&#160; &#8220;That looks <em>big</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And?&#160; You don&#8217;t care about people.&#160; You hate people.&#160; I quote, &#8216;people are stupid&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;They <em>are</em> stupid,&#8221; she answered.&#160; &#8220;And I&#8230; don&#8217;t like <em>most</em> people.&#160; Not the issue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What <em>is</em> the issue, then?&#8221;</p>\n<p>She stared.&#160; It had been a while since she&#8217;d stretched her legs, getting into the thick of things.&#160; That wasn&#8217;t it, though.&#160; She&#8217;d spent her entire life being <em>restless</em>, and now the restlessness was largely gone.</p>\n<p>Taylor, then?&#160; She thought of Taylor, and she couldn&#8217;t help but think of the way people had stood together, as if bracing to fight back if she caused trouble.&#160; Uniting against the bigger threat.</p>\n<p>She wasn&#8217;t dumb.&#160; These days, she felt better about herself and who she was than she ever had.&#160; But she admitted her failings.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not <em>articulate</em>d.</p>\n<p>She couldn&#8217;t put that idea into words like the others could.&#160; <em>Tattletale</em> could, obviously.&#160; Taylor&#8230; well, Taylor would have been able to.&#160; Imp could put her thoughts into words, but she&#8217;d probably be more confusing than helpful.</p>\n<p>It was frustrating, but it was a frustration she had come to peace with.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That many people in trouble, bound to be some dogs and dog owners in there,&#8221; Rachel lied.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>That&#8217;s </em>your reason?&#160; If you&#8217;re going to talk like that, you might as well be a fucking <em>superhero</em>,&#8221; Biter said.</p>\n<p>She ignored him.&#160; &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to come.&#160; Bastard, <em>go</em>!&#8221;</p>\n<p>She could feel the shifting of Bastard&#8217;s muscles, the little spot where one plate of calcified flesh dug into her knee riding up to mid-thigh.&#160; He jumped with an explosive kind of strength, crossing the street and landing on another rooftop.</p>\n<p>Even with Bastard absorbing the impact, it was a hard one.&#160; She grunted.&#160; The bruises and aches would be felt the next morning.</p>\n<p>It was easier to maneuver here.&#160; Probably had to do with the way the buildings were going up, everything following some plan or another.&#160; There was <em>order, </em>in this Boston.&#160; It made the city feel less like a city, on some levels, with too much uniformity in areas, but she could appreciate how it made it easier to move around.</p>\n<p>Another series of leaps.&#160; Shorter distances, with no big drops.&#160; Any pain she felt was from the first big jump.</p>\n<p>She could see the capes fighting, down below.&#160; A man was at the center of it.&#160; He&#8217;d swelled in size until he was twice the height he should be, almost breaking apart, like a statue that had been dropped, only the biggest chunks preserved, hanging in mid-air in a vague human shape, high above the street.&#160; Black ooze gushed from foot-wide cracks and divides in his body.&#160; His flesh was dark brown, the edges of the cracks raw and bloody.</p>\n<p>Even from her vantage point on the rooftop, she could hear his screams.&#160; It was muffled, despite the volume, as though he were screaming while underwater, the effect amplified.</p>\n<p>The capes were occupied &#8211; a very small few seemed to be trying to attack him.&#160; The rest were working to keep the black ooze from spreading.</p>\n<p>Rachel paused, watching.</p>\n<p>Miss Militia was down there.&#160; She had a containment foam gun, and was forming a short wall.</p>\n<p>The screaming got <em>worse</em>, and the man in the center broke in half, a crack widening in his torso until it separated completely.&#160; More ooze, faster.&#160; His lower body was almost impossible to see.</p>\n<p>His hands went to his head-</p>\n<p><em>Faces.&#160; Mockeries.&#160; Variations on a theme.&#160; Reaching hands, supplicating.</em></p>\n<p>-The image was brief, but acutely familiar.&#160; Rachel felt mentally disoriented in the same way she might be physically disoriented if she stepped forward and found the ground wasn&#8217;t there.&#160; Others in the area had staggered.&#160; Miss Militia had dropped the hose for the foam gun.</p>\n<p>Rachel gripped the chain that looped Bastard&#8217;s neck.&#160; When he was small, the same chain doubled as a leash.</p>\n<p>Familiar, comfortable.&#160; Reassuring, in the midst of this situation.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;d had visions before, she&#8217;d even remembered one, after the fight on the beach.&#160; They hadn&#8217;t been like that.&#160; It had been brief, and somehow broken up.</p>\n<p>Something was <em>wrong</em>.</p>\n<p>Someone shot the black ooze man, and his collarbone splintered, cracks spiderwebbing up to an oozing fissure in his neck and the stump of one shoulder.&#160; Rachel could see how more ooze was starting to bleed out from the site of the injury.</p>\n<p>He reacted, looking down at the injury, then looking up.</p>\n<p>He reached out, and the ooze below him shifted, moving in a singular direction as if it were flowing downhill.</p>\n<p>The cape who&#8217;d shot him hurried to run-</p>\n<p><em>A moment of uncertainty.&#160; The population of this world wasn&#8217;t reacting any further.&#160; He attacked, they moved.&#160; Again and again, they created the images.&#160; They weren&#8217;t afraid, and he was.</em></p>\n<p>-but stumbled as the mental image shook him.&#160; He managed to get his footing, but the ooze moved faster with each passing second, and the delay had cost him.&#160; It slopped around his ankles on its way past him.</p>\n<p>The black ooze man moved his hand, and the ooze that was pouring from him became black <em>fire</em>, spreading to alter all of the ooze it touched with a sound like the gas lanterns made, but a thousand times louder.&#160; Things touching the fire burned, and the dark sea was briefly highlighted in oranges, yellows and reds.</p>\n<p>The gunman who had attacked the ooze man dropped before he could react, his feet and lower legs burned away.&#160; When he touched the black fire, there was a brief flare of orange flame before he was obliterated.</p>\n<p>She had a sense of what she was up against, now.&#160; She surveyed the battlefield.&#160; The ground was rising into a crude bowl, containing the ooze, but a veritable waterfall flowed from the man&#8217;s ruined midsection, and the rate at which the bowl filled was outpacing the rate at which the bowl grew.</p>\n<p>There was a crash.&#160; Sunny and Cassie had arrived.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Biter?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not coming.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel scowled, but left it at that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Trigger.&#160; Something&#8217;s wrong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Trigger events can be plenty bad on their own.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mm,&#8221; Rachel grunted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh.&#160; Yeah.&#160; You know.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mm.&#160; You stay out of the way.&#160; Black stuff is bad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She didn&#8217;t wait for a response, ordering Bastard to head down towards the ground.&#160; Why?&#160; Hard to say, just like it was hard to explain the solidarity, or why she&#8217;d come in the first place.&#160; There were people out there who functioned best with their brains.&#160; Putting ideas together, analyzing the situation, rationalizing.&#160; She wasn&#8217;t one of them.&#160; She functioned best on instinct.</p>\n<p>Gut feeling?&#160; If this fight continued like this, it would turn out ugly.</p>\n<p>Miss Militia had shucked off the foam dispenser, and was backing up, shouting orders.&#160; She pulled the trigger on a small gun, sending a flare skyward.</p>\n<p>Rallying the troops.&#160; Made sense.</p>\n<p>The ooze man rose higher into the air, as she made her way down.&#160; There were people on the fringes, cornered or caught where they couldn&#8217;t freely maneuver.</p>\n<p>Bastard&#8217;s claws scraped against the side of the building on the way down, his front claws getting more traction than the rear ones.&#160; He wound up swinging, his hind end descending while his front end maintained a grip.&#160; Rachel was nearly flung off, but her hold on the chain kept her in place.&#160; Bastard elected to drop the remainder of the way to the ground.</p>\n<p>Another heavy impact.&#160; The imminent bruising went from &#8216;I&#8217;ll feel it in the morning&#8217; to &#8216;I&#8217;ll be feeling this all next week&#8217;.</p>\n<p>He was out of practice.&#160; Chasing buffalo and bringing them down was different from leaping around a city.</p>\n<p>But she was on the ground, free to run.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kip up!&#8221; she called.</p>\n<p>Bastard leaped, touching the side of the building, tensing and leaping from that point before landing on solid ground.&#160; In the process, they&#8217;d circumvented a large pool of the black stuff.</p>\n<p>They landed near one of the capes on the fringes, a man standing in a construction site, with enough stuff around him that he couldn&#8217;t maneuver freely. &#160; He was using his power to push at the ooze, a kind of telekinetic wind.&#160; Her arrival had distracted him, and the wind had faltered.&#160; The ooze encroached.</p>\n<p>She extended a hand.</p>\n<p>He glanced at the ooze, then at Bastard, and sided with her.&#160; He took her hand, and used his power to help himself up, landing behind her.</p>\n<p>She could see movement out of the corner of her eye.&#160; Tentacles, pitch black, reaching out of the ooze that poured from the man&#8217;s body.&#160; Like the fire, it spread, altering all of the ooze it touched to make it the same.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Up!&#160; Rooftop!&#8221; she called out.</p>\n<p>Bastard leaped, ascending by leaping from one wall to the next.&#160; By the time they were halfway up, the tendrils were almost touching them.</p>\n<p>They reached the last jump, leaping to the lower of the two rooftops, and stopped.&#160; They&#8217;d been snared, suspended over the street, the rooftop ten feet in front of Bastard&#8217;s front claws.</p>\n<p>Cassie was approaching, moving along rooftops to try and get to them.&#160; Below the rooftops, the entire neighborhood was a shifting morass of black fronds,grasping, seizing what they could, crushing.&#160; Fire and the lights of other powers were visible on the opposite side of the battlefield.&#160; Miss Militia&#8217;s group.&#160; A flamethrower-</p>\n<p><em>He tried to push the feelings away, but they were seductive.&#160; A spiral, where the feelings were both the torment and the balm that soothed the torment.&#160; Stopping was daunting</em>.&#160; <em>He had been wrapped up in them, and now it was something else.&#160; He&#8217;d never dealt with something like this.&#160; For hours, days, he&#8217;d been reveling in emotion, and now he couldn&#8217;t stow it away, even as he experienced trauma for the first time</em>.</p>\n<p>-torched the worst of the tendrils, keeping them at bay.&#160; The fire stopped as other capes stepped in.</p>\n<p>Rachel felt a frond seize her wrist.&#160; She pulled, and it didn&#8217;t give.&#160; Cassie wouldn&#8217;t make it in time.</p>\n<p>The telekinetic wind shifted from focusing on the fronds to focusing on Bastard.&#160; Pushing him in one direction, getting his claws closer to the rooftop.&#160; One and a half feet closer, two feet&#8230;</p>\n<p>At the same time, the rooftop changed.&#160; It twisted, inching closer to them.</p>\n<p>Rachel gave her companion a bit more power.&#160; Size at the expense of flexibility.</p>\n<p>Bastard extended his front claws and found a grip.&#160; He pulled himself and his riders closer, and the tendrils that encircled him went taut.&#160; All of his strength, and he couldn&#8217;t manage another inch of progress.&#160; Claws left gouges in the rooftop.</p>\n<p>Other tendrils encroached.&#160; There was no ooze on the ground, now.&#160; All of it was alive, a singular writhing mass that extended from the man above them.</p>\n<p>Distant gunshots sounded.&#160; They jerked forward, and Bastard got one claw on the edge of the roof.&#160; More traction.</p>\n<p>Two more gunshots.&#160; They were free.&#160; Bastard made it three steps before the black tentacle around Rachel&#8217;s wrist pulled tight.&#160; He took her sudden movement as a command and stopped, turning, his head moving so he could see any gestures or instructions.</p>\n<p>A red dot appeared on the tendril that gripped her.&#160; Another distant gunshot, and it was severed.&#160; Ooze splashed onto the rooftop.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bastard moved.</p>\n<p>Tendrils became fire in that same flowing transition, and the flaming liquid descended, covering the streets and buildings below them.&#160; There were flammable materials on some of the rooftops, where tall buildings were being extended to be higher, and black flames rose.</p>\n<p>High above them, the man continued to fall apart.&#160; Barely any fragments were larger than a fist, now.&#160; There was only the upper half of his head, a chunk in his chest.&#160; His legs were a pillar, framing the flow of the ooze that continued to spread beneath him.</p>\n<p>Capes had retreated to higher ground, but it wasn&#8217;t a refuge.&#160; The ooze would change again.</p>\n<p>Common sense told her she shouldn&#8217;t get any closer.&#160; Instinct told her otherwise.</p>\n<p>She directed Bastard to a lower rooftop, then one that was lower still.&#160; A pair of kid capes, fending off the spreading black flames with a combination of powers.</p>\n<p>There wasn&#8217;t time to be <em>nice</em> about it.&#160; She grabbed one, had Bastard grab the other.&#160; They ran for higher ground as the liquid fire became <em>mist</em>.</p>\n<p>It reminded her of Grue&#8217;s smoke.&#160; It spread to fill the air, and it moved too fast to avoid.&#160; Consuming everything, <em>covering</em> everything.&#160; The fires seemed to have gone out, or the black fire had overtaken any normal fire, but the damage was there.&#160; There were places where Bastard would fall through if he landed, balconies and rooftops.&#160; hazards.&#160; They were harder to see now, too, behind the mist.</p>\n<p>If he turned it into fire or tendrils <em>now</em>&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Up!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The heroes were hesitating to attack any more.&#160; Easy to see why.&#160; Every bit of damage seemed to increase the amount of ooze by a hell of a <em>lot</em>.</p>\n<p>He wasn&#8217;t dying, he wasn&#8217;t <em>stopping</em>.</p>\n<p>She ordered Bastard to higher ground, and the telekinetic wind helped them rise, where the added weight of the two kids slowed them down.&#160; The tallest building was near Miss Militia, so she circled around the area where the fight was taking place, constantly moving higher.&#160; A balcony nearly collapsed beneath Bastard&#8217;s weight.&#160; She misjudged a jump, urging Bastard on, while forgetting that she&#8217;d made him stronger and less agile.</p>\n<p>Down there, somewhere on the ground, Miss Militia was in the midst of the smoke, her team holding it at bay.&#160; She seemed to come to a decision.&#160; Her rifle became something else.&#160; A cannon, fixed to the ground.</p>\n<p>She shot into the black mist with a rocket.&#160; The rocket seemed to grow to twice the size as it flew.&#160; The explosion was dramatic, noisy, and distracted Bastard mid-landing, making him stumble.&#160; The explosion consumed the ooze man entirely.</p>\n<p>The amount of smoke flowing out around the man<em> doubled</em>.</p>\n<p>Two more rockets hit the same point, each one growing as it moved.</p>\n<p>The smoke cleared.&#160; The dust and smoke from the explosions slowly cleared.&#160; By the time the area was visible enough to check on their enemy, the black mist was starting to clear as well.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d been stopped.</p>\n<p>The visions, they&#8217;d been broken up, too recent.&#160; She wasn&#8217;t forgetting them.&#160; The power, too&#8230; he&#8217;d been strong.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d been-</p>\n<p><em>A man in a white hood and cape stood there, the tension in his body swiftly stopping.&#160; He had no expression, only a green and blue glow beneath his hood, but his body language was clear.&#160; Shock, defeat.</em></p>\n<p><em>A flash of golden light wiped him out of existence.</em></p>\n<p>-too strong.</p>\n<p>She started to turn her head, looking for the source of the voice, and felt the disorientation that had accompanied the visions.&#160; Her ride-alongs weren&#8217;t in better shape.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t over?</p>\n<p>Bastard&#8217;s head turned.&#160; His ears perked up.</p>\n<p>Instinct.&#160; She urged him towards whatever had gotten his attention.</p>\n<p>She could hear it, now.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hey,&#8221; the wind-maker said.&#160; &#8220;What-&#8221;</p>\n<p>He stopped when he heard the same sound.</p>\n<p>Screaming.&#160; As if from underwater, getting louder with each moment.</p>\n<p>There was somebody on a rooftop, in the midst of a garden, screaming.</p>\n<p>Her arm broke in half, and ooze began dripping from the injury.</p>\n<p>Bastard collided with her, and she broke apart, ooze flowing like a wave, tossing them aside.&#160; It was defensive as much as offensive.</p>\n<p>Except it seemed to be hurting its host more than anything.&#160; The force of the flowing ooze was damaging her body, tearing her apart.&#160; Her eyes were gone, with only dark sockets streaming more fluid.&#160; When she opened her mouth, more erupted forth, flowing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Again,</em>&#8221; Rachel whispered.</p>\n<p>Bastard found his feet, readying for another attack.&#160; She could feel the tension as he prepared to leap.</p>\n<p><em>Just have to break her enough.</em></p>\n<p>The ooze froze into jagged crystal.&#160; Bastard&#8217;s leap failed, and he nearly bucked his riders free.</p>\n<p>The freezing had spread through the ooze that covered the woman, and the jagged spikes of black ice tore through her upper body and head.</p>\n<p>For long seconds, things were still.</p>\n<p>And then the woman came to pieces.&#160; The ice broke, and Bastard pulled himself free.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Jesus,&#8221; the wind-man said.</p>\n<p>Rachel was silent, watching the back of Bastard&#8217;s head.&#160; He hadn&#8217;t reacted like he&#8217;d heard more screaming.&#160; Was it over?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hey kids, are you-&#8221; the man started.&#160; He was silenced as Bastard leaped, retracing his route to the ground.</p>\n<p>More hard landings, but she was already resigned to the aches and pains that would follow a fight.</p>\n<p>When they touched solid ground, Miss Militia&#8217;s entire group was waiting.&#160; Vista was there, along with one of Taylor&#8217;s teammates from Chicago.</p>\n<p>Bastard landed, and Rachel was careful to keep a distance.&#160; Miss Militia stepped forward, and Rachel directed Bastard to back up a little.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We going to have a problem?&#8221; Rachel called out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No.&#160; No problem,&#8221; Miss Militia said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m coming closer, okay?&#160; We&#8217;re good.&#160; There&#8217;s an amnesty.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know what that means.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a deal.&#160; Everyone gets a second chance.&#160; We don&#8217;t have a problem with <em>anyone</em>, until they do something wrong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a villain anymore?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not unless you want to do something villainous.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel nodded.</p>\n<p>Miss Militia approached.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It shifted to a new host,&#8221; the wind-man said.&#160; &#8220;That was definitely another one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel gave a push to the kid she&#8217;d slung over Bastard&#8217;s shoulders.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Get down,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; &#8220;Bastard, drop it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bastard let the boy he was holding drop, along with a fair amount of slobber.&#160; The boy hurried back.&#160; The girl was taking more time to find her way to the ground.&#160; Rachel grabbed at her arm, and the girl flinched.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You dealt with it?&#8221;&#160; Miss Militia asked, stepping closer to give the girl a hand.</p>\n<p>The wind-man wasn&#8217;t moving.&#160; &#8220;It dealt with itself.&#160; The power destroyed the host.&#160; That&#8217;s number two on the list of things that aren&#8217;t supposed to happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shit happens,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; &#8220;World makes a lot more sense when you accept that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a little different from the everyday sh-tuff,&#8221; the man said.</p>\n<p>Miss Militia nodded, her eyebrows knit together in concern.&#160; &#8220;This makes four.&#160; Almost a fifth of the regular triggers we&#8217;ve heard of.&#160; Two in three days.&#160; One&#8217;s still loose, the others died or destroyed themselves.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hey, wind-man,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; &#8220;Off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just waiting for Gloss to get down.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Off.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>He heard something in her tone and moved, using his power to hop down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hellhound-&#8221; Miss Militia said.&#160; Rachel gave her a hard look. &#160; &#8220;Um.&#160; <em>Bitch</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to fucking give me trouble after what you said before, then-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>No.</em>&#8221;&#160; Miss Militia said.&#160; She raised her hands, showing she was unarmed.&#160; The mortar was a distance away.&#160; &#8220;Thank you.&#160; <em>That&#8217;s</em> what I wanted to say.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel shrugged, averting her eyes.&#160; She couldn&#8217;t help but feel surrounded, here.&#160; &#8220;I was looking for you anyways.&#160; This is your territory?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a little complicated.&#160; The-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You work here?&#160; Do the superhero thing?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, but-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s yours,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; Others had told her she could sound hostile in situations like this, so she tried to speak like she would to a dog that hadn&#8217;t been exposed to humans.&#160; Gentle, acknowledging the fact that it couldn&#8217;t understand.&#160; The sound was more important than anything.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Um, I suppose,&#8221; Miss Militia said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; Rachel said, trying to measure her tone, suppressing her irritation.&#160; &#8220;If someone else is in charge, you tell them this instead.&#160; Some fuckstick came into <em>my</em> fucking neighborhood, cozied up to his old girlfriend, then waltzed with their kid.&#160; Came here.&#160; I was looking for the asshole, and I wanted to let you know before I went to collect them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Miss Militia said, sounding a little more authoritarian.&#160; She glanced at the wind-man, who had his hands clamped to the boy&#8217;s ears.&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Okay?&#8221;&#160; Rachel gave Bastard a light kick, indicating he should go.</p>\n<p>&#8220;-Problematic!&#8221;&#160; Miss Militia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>But Rachel was already leaving.&#160; She heard Miss Militia&#8217;s voice, swearing, running footsteps.</p>\n<p>Didn&#8217;t matter.&#160; A glance to the rooftops indicated that Biter had arrived.&#160; He had a man and a little boy with him.</p>\n<p>She pointed, and she could see a nod on Biter&#8217;s part.</p>\n<p style="text-align:center;">&#9632;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">From civilization to nature.&#160; She could relax.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Didn&#8217;t realize it would be that serious,&#8221; Biter said, when they&#8217;d slowed.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Seeing Bastard panting, Rachel led him to the water.&#160; The other dogs followed, eager for the chance to drink.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Not an issue.&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;See, this <em>is</em> an area where you should get on my case, get mad that I didn&#8217;t help.&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;I told you it was fine,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;So it&#8217;s fine.&#160; Who the fuck doesn&#8217;t say what they mean?&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Most people?&#8221; he asked.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Most people are morons,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;Bitching about wanting french fries or whatever.&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;A strong <em>recommendation</em>, not a&#8230; bitch,&#8221; he said, stumbling over the last word.&#160; &#8220;Thank you, by the way.&#160; I appreciate your willingness to stop.&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Kid needed food anyways,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; She looked at the boy who was riding with Cassie.&#160; The girl had opened her jacket and zipped it up so it held him to her.&#160; &#8220;He good?&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;A little spooked, tired.&#160; It&#8217;s a long way to travel, even with breaks,&#8221; Cassie said, &#8220;But I think he&#8217;s mostly good?&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">She&#8217;d made it a question, looking down, and the boy nodded.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Issue&#8217;s handled.&#160; Take the kid to his mom, take the dad to a cell.&#160; We figure out what we do with him tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Right,&#8221; Biter said.&#160; &#8220;And you?&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Going for a ride,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; She jerked her thumb over her shoulder.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Biter said.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Say hi to her for me?&#8221; Cassie asked.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Rachel nodded.&#160; &#8220;Anything else?&#160; Stuff?&#160; Problems?&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;No,&#8221; Biter said.&#160; &#8220;Thanks for the burger-stop.&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Rachel shrugged.&#160; She gave Doon a bit more power, to ensure he got the rest of the way home, then hopped off Bastard&#8217;s back.&#160; She led him by the chain as she walked down the path.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">The fields had tall grass, and the light frost hadn&#8217;t done much to dampen the effect.&#160; In the afternoon light, it glittered and sparkled.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">There&#8217;d been a problem.&#160; She hadn&#8217;t missed that.&#160; Some new powers weren&#8217;t working the way they should.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">She&#8217;d have to talk to Tattletale about it.&#160; Figure out what it meant, and whether she needed to do something in case one of her people went down that road.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">She was losing Biter.&#160; This wasn&#8217;t the life for him.&#160; He was loyal, he wasn&#8217;t dumb, and he wasn&#8217;t a bad lay, if she was in the mood for that.&#160; Didn&#8217;t, unlike some, make it more than it should be.&#160; He took it in stride.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">She&#8217;d barely had time to register that he was going, before the trouble started.&#160; It bothered her more than it should.</p>\n<p>People came, people went.&#160; There were so many reasons for it all.&#160; It was exhausting to keep track of.&#160; Sometimes impossible.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">She led Bastard down a path towards the mountains.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">She stopped at a spot where the path crested a hill, between two peaks.&#160; Not all the way through the mountains, but far enough that she could see the ocean.&#160; The Bay.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">Bastard knew the way.&#160; His flesh was sloughing off, and he was slower, but he was adroit enough to navigate the rocks.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">At the side of one mountain, here, a tree had fallen into a &#8216;v&#8217; where another tree stood.&#160; with a glimpse of the spot where the city should be.&#160; Water had filled the cracks where the landscape had been ruined.&#160; When the trees had had leaves, they had framed the view.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">At the top of this hill, rocks had been rolled into place, some with the help of her dogs.</p>\n<p style="text-align:left;">She sat down with her back to the biggest.</p>\n<p>Her hand settled on one rock, and she gave it a rub, like it was a dog&#8217;s head.&#160; Some left like Biter was leaving, while others were gone forever.</p>\n<p>Bastard growled, then barked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; Rachel called out.&#160; She sat forward, looking towards the path.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Am I intruding?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel tensed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d like,&#8221; Miss Militia said, stepping into view.&#160; Her eyes surveyed the scene.&#160; &#8220;We could talk somewhere else.&#160; If you want to respect the sanctity of this place.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good sitting place.&#160; If we have to talk, we can talk here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sounds good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bastard growled.&#160; Rachel gestured, giving the order, &#8220;Stand down, Bastard.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bastard sat, visibly relaxing.</p>\n<p>Miss Militia nodded.&#160; &#8220;Just so you aren&#8217;t surprised, you should know I brought Vista.&#160; Wanted to cover more ground, catch up to you sooner.&#160; Didn&#8217;t work out, with us having to stop to double check for your tracks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel shrugged.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hi,&#8221; the blonde girl said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m kind of glad I was brought along.&#160; Seeing home again, kind of.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Rachel said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A memorial?&#8221; Vista asked, laying a hand against the largest stone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Can I ask who for?&#160; Or is that a dumb question?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dumb question,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; She leaned back, resting her head against the stone behind her.&#160; When Vista didn&#8217;t respond, Rachel relented.&#160; She pointed at where the two trees rested against one another by the cliff face.&#160; &#8220;When the weather was warm, there was a bee&#8217;s nest there.&#160; The buzzing doesn&#8217;t bother me as much as you&#8217;d think.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh.&#160; Well, listen, last thing I want to do is disrespect that.&#160; I&#8217;ve said goodbye to too many people, myself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel nodded.&#160; &#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you wanted, I could shape them.&#160; Been working on the little details.&#160; Could do a statue, or letters.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No point,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; &#8220;Anyone who&#8217;s been here and seen them knows who they&#8217;re for.&#160; I don&#8217;t care about the others.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gotcha,&#8221; Vista said.</p>\n<p>Vista found a seat with her back to the rock.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to talk,&#8221; Miss Militia said, leaning against the cliff wall, arms folded.</p>\n<p>Rachel nodded.&#160; &#8220;Okay.&#160; Talk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you handle a custody dispute like you handled&#8230; that.&#160; Attacking someone, beating him up, hauling him a hundred miles away to another city.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kid was mine to look after.&#160; The mom was mine to look after.&#160; I&#8217;m supposed to just let it happen?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are options.&#160; You could talk to us, ask.&#160; We&#8217;d find a middle ground.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Talking is a pain in the ass.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is.&#160; I&#8217;ve been a team leader for a bit, now, and I agree one hundred percent.&#160; Worst part of the job.&#160; But it&#8217;s better to talk than to make enemies, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel sighed.&#160; &#8220;Sometimes I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The amnesty is your best friend right now.&#160; If you don&#8217;t want to do the talking, maybe you can ask Tattletale, and <em>she</em> can?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t talk as much.&#160; Different places, doing different things.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>People leave.</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;It would be an excuse to keep in touch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel shrugged.&#160; &#8220;If I don&#8217;t deal with my own stuff, what&#8217;s the point?&#160; I&#8217;d rather be in control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about the rules.&#160; Rules you understand, rules you don&#8217;t.&#160; Being in the city, I was sort of realizing just how many there are.&#160; Codes, deals, even the way we dress, apparently.&#160; Hard to keep track of.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You want me to ask Tattletale to handle shit.&#160; But I&#8217;d prefer to handle my own shit.&#160; That way, I know what&#8217;s what.&#160; There&#8217;s no ugly surprises.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She stopped, rephrased, &#8220;There&#8217;s <em>less</em> ugly surprises.&#160; This asshole that&#8217;s working for me?&#160; All of a sudden, he tells me he&#8217;s not happy.&#160; <em>French fries</em> are more important, or something stupid like that.&#160; I dunno how to argue with him, because I don&#8217;t <em>understand</em> it.&#160; They&#8217;re supposed to be some symbol or shit like that and I don&#8217;t get it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Been there,&#8221; Vista said.&#160; She looked cold, even with the tights she wore with her costume.&#160; She rubbed her legs, then hugged them.&#160; &#8220;Losing people, not being able to understand <em>why</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you wanted, we could connect you to someone you could talk to,&#8221; Miss Militia said.</p>\n<p>Rachel shrugged.&#160; &#8220;Talking bugs me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But as much as it bugged her, she found the words spilling out.&#160; &#8220;I can get him wanting to go.&#160; I don&#8217;t understand it, but he says he needs that shit, so long as I&#8217;m handling stuff on my own, I can maybe grab him some damn french fries, keep him from leaving for a little while.&#160; Maybe give him some more time here and there so he could go buy more.&#160; Or whatever.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I see what you&#8217;re getting at.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And <em>some</em> <em>idiots</em>,&#8221; Rachel said, banging her head against the rock behind her, a little harder than she&#8217;d intended, in a spot where the rock jutted out.&#160;&#160; The sharp pain brought tears to her eyes.&#160; &#8220;Are even harder to understand than the motherfucking french fry thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Miss Militia said.</p>\n<p>Rachel rubbed the stone to her right.&#160; <em>Brutus</em>.&#160; Bastard approached and laid his head down on the rock, and she gave him a good scratch.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The rules are changing, breaking down,&#8221; Miss Militia said.&#160; &#8220;Powers, groups, between capes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shit happens,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; &#8220;I said something like that earlier, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You did.&#160; But I don&#8217;t agree.&#160; I don&#8217;t want things to break down.&#160; I don&#8217;t want conflict.&#160; We were on opposite sides, but we were <em>there.&#160; </em>We went through a lot of the same stuff.&#160; Can we not end this as enemies, fighting because of some misunderstanding?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Vista spoke, looking out at the bay.&#160; &#8220;Make it a Brockton Bay thing.&#160; We&#8217;re motherfuckers, we&#8217;re survivors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not sure I get it.&#160; But I don&#8217;t fucking trust people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>She</em> wanted us to work together,&#8221; Miss Militia said, emphasizing the &#8216;she&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Rachel looked up, but Miss Militia was staring out at the water.</p>\n<p>Her voice was a growl.&#160; &#8220;If you&#8217;re fucking manipulating me, I&#8217;m going to have Bastard chew you up and spit you out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No manipulation.&#160; Look, let&#8217;s get down to brass tacks.&#160; The basics.&#160; What do you <em>want</em>, Rachel?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Me and mine get left alone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can agree to that.&#160; We&#8217;ll leave you alone, we&#8217;ll help make sure others leave you alone.&#160; But, if we&#8217;re making our own rules, between us, <em>my</em> rule is I want to know before you do anything outside your territory.&#160; Let me know, and you can ride along, so you&#8217;re clued in and not missing anything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel nodded, giving Bastard another scratch.&#160; &#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A starting point?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A starting point,&#8221; Rachel agreed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I talked to Tattletale before I came.&#160; You should get in touch.&#160; She had some stuff she wanted to discuss.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel nodded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Can we trust each other?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel frowned.</p>\n<p>Trust.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;d lost hers right in the beginning.&#160; Left alone in an apartment, to starve and scald herself.</p>\n<p>Here?&#160; Now?&#160; Seventeen years later?&#160; After any number of betrayals, great and small?</p>\n<p>She was aware of the tall stone behind her.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>\n'<h1 id="chap11">Teneral e.5</h1>b'<p><em>Head high.&#160; Shoulders square.&#160; Walk like you know where you&#8217;re going, like you belong.</em></p>\n<p>He&#8217;d had the best teachers around.&#160; Public speakers, flirts, con artists, actors, thieves, magicians, and cutthroats.&#160; He&#8217;d been educated in history, foreign affairs, management and internal affairs, intelligence, and codebreaking.&#160; He&#8217;d learned from the best in medicine and poisons, in parahuman studies, in accounting and trade, the sciences, strategy and tactics in military, government and business roles.&#160; He knew how to make things, and how to fake them.</p>\n<p>Even in the little things, hobbies to some and unlikely careers to the foolhardy, he&#8217;d achieved some degree of competence.&#160; Music, singing, art, prose and dance.&#160; All it took was the right teacher, a <em>hungry</em> eagerness to learn, and time.</p>\n<p>One could not lead, after all, with one eye closed.&#160; Some could lead while admitting some ignorance in one department or another, but he wasn&#8217;t <em>some</em>.</p>\n<p>He was a jack of all trades, master of quite a few.</p>\n<p>Two of those &#8216;few&#8217; accompanied him.&#160; A woman in a white bodysuit walked just to his left.&#160; He&#8217;d picked her because she had a natural grace and self-assurance, but her name escaped him.&#160; He could remember how he had found her.&#160; She&#8217;d been a hero, and she&#8217;d watched her team die in the aftermath of the attack.&#160; Lost, helpless, broken.&#160; Now she stood tall, back straight, joking and laughing with her companion.</p>\n<p>The <em>real</em> her was numb, locked in a cage, but that was secondary to the point.</p>\n<p>The other was numb too, but not in the same way.&#160; He was very much <em>himself</em>.&#160; If he was disconnected, it was a natural sort of disconnection, the sort that had happened billions of times throughout human history.</p>\n<p>But the man was talented.&#160; He wasn&#8217;t acting like he belonged, because he <em>did</em> belong.&#160; He was a free spirit, and the world was his oyster.&#160; He could put on a different face, and it wouldn&#8217;t be a mask, but a <em>role</em>.</p>\n<p>He was a warrior, wearing heavy armor.&#160; Gruff, rugged, with a beard and the stylings of a viking, complete with fur as part of his costume.&#160; When the woman in white found herself off balance, stumbling, he picked his words to counterbalance it, changing the thrust of their interaction.&#160; He teased, leaving the road open for clear and unambiguous responses, making small jokes so she could laugh and find her mental footing.</p>\n<p>In a very one sided way, he was sustaining and supporting what appeared to be a very natural dialogue between longtime friends.</p>\n<p>A pair of heroes rounded the corner, glancing at them.&#160; The &#8216;viking&#8217; was in the midst of making a joke.</p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;six different flavors of sausage.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The woman frowned.&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s a non sequi-&#160; oh.&#160; <em>Oh.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watching the woman turn red, seeing the viking laugh, he couldn&#8217;t help but join in on the laughter, a chuckle.</p>\n<p>The viking slung an armored arm around his shoulders, making him stumble.&#160; &#8220;You actually laughed!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It <em>was</em> a little funny.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A <em>little</em>?&#8221;&#160; the viking asked.&#160; He nodded at the pair of heroes as the two groups crossed paths.&#160; He offered the words, &#8220;Hey, Ironscale.&#160; &#8216;Sup?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know you?&#8221; one of the pair asked, stopping in the middle of the hallway.</p>\n<p>The viking was still walking, but turned around to walk backwards as he called out, &#8220;Costume change to fit in with the new era, my friend!&#160; You&#8217;ll figure it out, and I&#8217;ll be <em>very</em> upset with you if you don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>\n<p>They rounded the corner.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Did you know him?&#160; This Ironscale?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The viking smiled.&#160; &#8220;Ironscale?&#160; No.&#160; A face in a file, at some point.&#160; But I have a good memory.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Liars have to.</em>&#160; &#8220;It was dangerous, baiting him.&#160; Better if we don&#8217;t draw attention.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Trying to <em>avoid</em> attention is attention-getting enough.&#160; You brought me on board for my skills, Teacher.&#160; Trust me to use them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Teacher sighed.&#160; &#8220;Fair.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The smile disappeared from the viking&#8217;s face.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;re nervous.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <em>inclined</em> to think I&#8217;m paranoid,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; &#8220;I try to convince myself otherwise.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m going to explain, I have to ask,&#8221; Teacher said, &#8220;what&#8217;s the difference between paranoia and nervousness?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;One is a state of mind, the other is a temporary state of emotion?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The former is a kind of madness,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; &#8220;Popular culture has twisted it, but popular culture has twisted <em>madness</em> in general.&#160; They make it funny, they romanticize it, or they make it exaggerated.&#160; But true mental illness is nothing to laugh at.&#160; I stayed in the Birdcage for some time, I&#8217;ve seen scary things, and I&#8217;ve become numb to a great deal, but going mad is perhaps the scariest.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yet you corrected me when I said you were nervous,&#8221; the viking said, strangely soft spoken given his frame and earlier demeanor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The alternative to being a madman might be worse,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; He shook his head, as if stirring himself from a spell.&#160; &#8220;What were we talking about?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Is this your first time in the infiltration role?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In a meaningful capacity?&#160; Yes,&#8221; Teacher admitted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You could have stayed behind.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to handle this face to face, build a rapport.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You could have let me do that for you, build your rapport for you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s a dangerous road to travel.&#160; Will we do that the next time?&#160; And the time after that?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I could not be a leader if I didn&#8217;t actually <em>lead</em>.&#160; Besides, I don&#8217;t trust you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You think I&#8217;ll stab you in the back?&#8221; the viking asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think <em>everyone</em> will stab me in the back,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; He sighed.&#160; &#8220;Paranoia, again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you keep walking down this road, then they probably <em>will</em> stab you in the back.&#160; That joke, &#8216;it&#8217;s not paranoia if everyone really is out to get you&#8217; could be a self-fulfilling prophecy in your case.&#160; Maybe you&#8217;re even doing it on purpose.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You might be even smarter than you let on,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t brainwash you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The man chuckled.</p>\n<p>Teacher shook his head.&#160; &#8220;I aim to change course.&#160; If they plan to ambush me at some point down that road, they&#8217;ll be waiting a long time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s simple enough, when you only have one enemy.&#160; But when you have as many as you do&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It requires a more blatant change of course to throw them off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you say so.&#160; You seem to have things in hand right now, at least.&#160; This way.&#160; We&#8217;ll be entering an area with higher security, so be on guard.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Teacher glanced up at the camera.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t trust your people to handle it?&#8221;&#160; the viking asked.</p>\n<p>Teacher shook his head.&#160; &#8220;I trust them.&#160; Put enough on a job, and the only one who could work around them is Dragon, and Dragon isn&#8217;t here, nor is she able to work against me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You think.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I <em>think</em>.&#160; Let&#8217;s not underestimate Big Sister.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In case you were wondering, I think that&#8217;s intelligence, not paranoia,&#8221; the viking said.</p>\n<p>The viking tapped his phone against the panel by the door.&#160; Teacher tensed.&#160; Waiting.</p>\n<p>The light went green, and there was a sound as bolts moved.&#160; He let himself relax.</p>\n<p>The viking spoke in a low voice as they entered.&#160; &#8220;Level one security.&#160; Not cells, exactly, because the people here haven&#8217;t technically done anything wrong, and the amnesty protects them, but they can&#8217;t be allowed to freely wander the building, with sensitive materials and unmasked heroes around.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, they can&#8217;t have troublemakers walking about, can they?&#8221;&#160; Teacher asked, with a note of irony.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The people staying in the level one security area get chaperones when they want to go somewhere, and cameras keep an eye on them&#8230; usually.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Teacher glanced around.&#160; Where there had been offices in the previous area of the complex, this area was residential.&#160; Some of the doors here were open, showing clean apartments with everything neat and in order, waiting for an occupant.</p>\n<p>Some, though, were inhabited.&#160; Each resident had made the space their own.&#160; One appeared to be layered in a crusting of junk &#8211; bottlecaps and glass shards arranged in kaleidoscopic patterns.&#160; Another was all black leather and chrome, smelling faintly of an expensive aftershave.</p>\n<p>They stopped at the doorway to another room.&#160; There was little doubt in their minds after they saw the interior.&#160; A folding screen with a dragon print and women in kimonos on it was below iconic pin up images, modern and dated.&#160; 50&#8217;s pin up girls alongside recent celebrities. The way they were organized and clustered, it seemed somehow less like decoration and more like&#8230; character studies?</p>\n<p>From their vantage point, the corner of a four-poster bed was visible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ingenue,&#8221; Teacher called out.</p>\n<p>Feet swung out over the side of the bed, and she was standing in a moment.&#160; She stopped short when saw him, pouting, one fist against her hip.&#160; Dramatized, artificial.&#160; Even the way she dressed, it was the same, a silk bathrobe that was short enough to be borderline indecent.&#160; Always putting on a show, and not in the sense of showing <em>skin</em>, but acting, putting on a mask.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You got my hopes up.&#160; It&#8217;s <em>you</em>,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;Dressed up like a wizard, maybe, but it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> good a disguise.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t have to be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shame on you, not even calling a girl before you show up unannounced&#8230; but you were never very classy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m afraid not.&#160; If you&#8217;d like to talk to <em>Marquis</em>, I&#8217;m sure he could oblige on that front.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;He switches from the aristocrat to the low born commoner as it suits him.&#160; Split personality.&#160; Is that what this is all about?&#160; Are you planning on gathering us all together again?&#160; Clinging to the past, Teacher?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was planning on visiting him, but not for the past, and not to gather anyone.&#160; Not in that sense.&#160; I&#8217;m touching base with certain people, nothing more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Getting the lay of the land,&#8221; he said.&#160; He saw her put on a shocked expression, then cut her off before she could speak, &#8220;<em>Assessing the situation</em>, Ingenue.&#160; There&#8217;s a great deal going on, and I&#8217;d rather work with known quantities before I start interacting with foreign ones.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Should I ask <em>why now</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;For someone who is feigning disinterest, you&#8217;re asking an awful lot of questions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <em>bored</em>, Teacher.&#160; I&#8217;m even losing interest in Chevalier, and he doesn&#8217;t find time for me, unless it&#8217;s to make sure I&#8217;m being a good girl.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Do you fancy a trip, then?&#160; A walk outside?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;My jailors, who seem very invested in declaring they aren&#8217;t actually jailors, might take umbrage.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have you back by curfew, if you&#8217;re still interested by then.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re <em>planning</em> something,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; she said.&#160; She put her hands into the pockets of her dressing gown, which were too small for her whole hands.&#160; &#8220;And maybe I&#8217;ll go on this field trip of yours.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The viking leaned in close to Teacher, &#8220;Time.&#160; If they did notice anything&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>He trailed off.&#160; There was no need to spell it out.</p>\n<p>Teacher nodded a little, but he continued, unruffled.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m looking to put together something <em>bigger</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Bigger than?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Than any of the teams currently in operation.&#160; Than any of the powers we&#8217;ve seen yet.&#160; Call it megalomania, if you will.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why?&#160; Before you say anything, you should know that &#8216;because I can&#8217; isn&#8217;t an answer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was never the answer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done a lot of things, and everything indicates it was for that very reason.&#160; Cas Raul?&#8221; Ingenue asked.&#160; She was relaxing now, the guise dropping.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done a lot of things, agreed, but there were always other motivations.&#160; I admit, I was younger then, the plans were cruder.&#160; But the plans still worked and there <em>was</em> a goal involved.&#160; For some time, I&#8217;d been gathering information and putting pawns in place, starting to get a feel for how the dynamic was all put together.&#160; The connections between people and groups, the powers at play, the choices being made and <em>why</em> those choices were made.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And this leads to the murder of a vice president how?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Killing a man that prominent sets everything into motion.&#160; That motion lets me see things from different angles, filling in the blanks.&#160; I needed to do something big to disturb the dynamic enough that I could glimpse the <em>real </em>big picture and fill in the blanks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Big picture.&#160; You&#8217;re talking about significant things, again.&#160; On par with killing a vice president and a prime minister.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a little more impressive.&#160; In any event, I got the information I wanted with my play, first the national death, then the international one, to see the effects and plot things out on the global scale.&#160; I was all set to act on it when I got arrested.&#160; I was left with years to think, to study and improve myself.&#160; I plotted our release to keep myself sane, and to keep things in motion.&#160; You&#160;<em>are</em> welcome for that, by the way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ingenue shrugged.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I got free, then I took action, equipped with my new knowledge.&#160; It didn&#8217;t take long for opportunity to present itself, and now I&#8217;m very well set up.&#160; I found the missing puzzle piece and I made it my own, mystery and all.&#160; Some of their assets are my assets now, and I have the footing to do something else entirely.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A subject you&#8217;re dancing around.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nothing particularly criminal, believe it or not.&#160; But it would be silly of me to tell you everything if you were going to refuse my invitation and then tell your chosen boyfriend at the first opportunity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know each other, Teacher.&#160; You don&#8217;t <em>really</em> think I&#8217;m that one-note.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No.&#160; No, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yet you won&#8217;t tell me.&#160; You&#8217;re a <em>tease</em>, Teacher.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m-&#8221;</p>\n<p>His phone beeped.&#160; Two high notes, in quick succession.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An alert?&#8221; the viking asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I may have overestimated my collective&#8217;s ability to keep us out of sight,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; &#8220;Miss?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The woman in white raised an eyebrow.&#160; &#8220;No <em>immediate</em> threats.&#160; But it&#8217;s hard to tell.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He nodded, glancing at the door.&#160; <em>No police officers in power armor</em>, he mused.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;Ingenue-&#8221;</p>\n<p>He stopped.&#160; He&#8217;d turned, and she wasn&#8217;t there.&#160; Invisibility wasn&#8217;t one of her powers, but-</p>\n<p>The dressing gown flew into the air, draping itself over the top of the dragon-print folding screen in the corner.&#160; She was on the other side.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I see you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;re coming.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m bored,&#8221; she said, from behind the screen.&#160; &#8220;They can give me my art, good food, entertainment, chaperones to plays, but I want <em>one</em> thing, and they won&#8217;t give him to me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re leaving to kick up a fuss, so he has to come after you&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m done with him,&#8221; Ingenue declared.&#160; She stepped out from behind the screen in a dress with a high lacy collar.&#160; &#8220;His loss.&#160; You know, I&#8217;m aware my boyfriends have had a run of bad luck.&#160; I&#8217;m not <em>oblivious</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re cursed,&#8221; the viking commented.</p>\n<p>She smiled, leaning over her dresser to peer at herself in an oval-frame mirror, snatching up some lipstick to touch herself up.&#160; &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say that.&#160; A good love story ends in tragedy, doesn&#8217;t it?&#160; Outcome aside, isn&#8217;t it glorious in its own way?&#160; I&#8217;ve had more than a few of these stories.&#160; I&#8217;ve suffered heartbreak, even, but I&#8217;m tougher than I look.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So Chevalier has slipped the noose?&#8221;&#160; Teacher asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;More apt to say he&#8217;s stepped out of the frying pan,&#8221; Ingenue said, running a brush over her jaw-length hair, &#8220;The only ones who end up worse than my boyfriends are my <em>ex-</em>boyfriends.&#160; It&#8217;s so sad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She turned around, hair and makeup done, and there was no warmth in her eyes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;His loss, as you said,&#8221; Teacher commented.</p>\n<p>She frowned a little, but her eyes didn&#8217;t waver or change in how cold they seemed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming,&#8221; his student said.&#160; &#8220;Two.&#160; Same way we came.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shall we?&#8221;&#160; He indicated the door.</p>\n<p>They left.&#160; The moment they were in the hallway, the doors at the end opened.</p>\n<p>Dragon&#8217;s Teeth.&#160; Civilians with power armor and training.</p>\n<p>His power was a problem, here.&#160; He produced thinkers and tinkers, but they were low level, limited in scale.&#160; A precog that warned of danger a few seconds before that danger arrived wasn&#8217;t so useful.</p>\n<p>Still, it meant the Dragon&#8217;s Teeth were more surprised than they were.&#160; A chance to bolt for it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I worked so hard to get down to security level one,&#8221; Ingenue pouted.&#160; &#8220;Dashed in a moment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you were planning on coming back?&#8221; Teacher made the statement a question, leading the way around a corner.&#160; <em>The stairwell will be locked down, but if we can find an apartment to duck into, we could slip out.</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;A girl likes to hold on to her reputation,&#8221; Ingenue said.&#160; &#8220;Even if that reputation is merely &#8216;dangerous&#8217; and not &#8216;cataclysmic&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>With those doors and the stairwell barred, we have nine escape routes.</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;While I was scouting the area,&#8221; the viking said, &#8220;I heard a few people making noise about you.&#160; Word was out you&#8217;d scuffed the ground with your toe while batting your eyelashes at one of the jailors, and they wanted to raise you to back to &#8216;cataclysmic&#8217;.&#160; Well, they said &#8216;level two security&#8217;, so maybe something less severe.&#160; What&#8217;s between dangerous and cataclysmic?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it would be unwise to say, for fear of offending our colleague,&#8221; Teacher said.<em></em></p>\n<p>&#8220;I think so too,&#8221; Ingenue agreed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If it makes you feel any better, I think they&#8217;re badly underestimating you,&#8221; Teacher said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kind of you to say so, but I&#8217;m not dangerous.&#160; Mere slander and lies.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Obession and self-delusion.&#160; Her particular madness?&#160; Or is she better at acting than I suspected?&#160; Is it merely that she&#8217;s told herself these lies so often she believes them?</em></p>\n<p>They found an empty apartment and eased the door closed.</p>\n<p>Teacher reached into the front of his robe and withdrew a disc of metal.&#160; He tossed it to the ground.</p>\n<p>The lights fritzed out.&#160; It wasn&#8217;t merely a blackout, but a momentary, violent crackle that traveled throughout the apartment and across the floor.</p>\n<p>The teleportation device didn&#8217;t activate.&#160; The armor around the man in the viking outfit fizzled and disappeared, panel by panel, revealing itself as the hologram it was.&#160; He wore only knee-length, skintight shorts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re more on the ball than we anticipated,&#8221; the near-naked viking said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Run interference?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The man nodded, and His flesh began distorting.</p>\n<p>Osmosis of a full human being.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope that wasn&#8217;t the full extent of your escape plan,&#8221; Ingenue said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll be peevish if I get moved up to another security quadrant because of this embarrassing little stunt of yours, an escape attempt lasting all of five minutes.&#160; I <em>hate</em> being peevish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are&#8230; seven options left,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;I did plan for this.&#160; This is an <em>incomplete</em> shutdown, so we have some freedom to-&#8221;</p>\n<p>The windows began closing.&#160; Metal shutters.&#160; The apartment was plunged into darkness.&#160; No lights, only the light that slipped through slits in the metal walls.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a <em>complete</em> shutdown,&#8221; he revised his statement.&#160; &#8220;Still seven options left.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You knew about this, I hope,&#8221; Ingenue commented.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I <em>said</em> I knew about their safety measures,&#8221; Teacher snapped.&#160; &#8220;Not an issue.&#160; I suppose my plan for a surprise shutdown is the clearest at this time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just what is this working plan of yours?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to avoid capture for&#8230;&#8221; he looked down at his watch.&#160; It had stopped.&#160; &#8220;&#8230;An indeterminate period of time.&#160; Less than five minutes.&#160; Not an issue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not an issue?&#160; When we&#8217;re in the heart of a complex that houses the largest group of heroes from the largest city in the known worlds,&#8221; Ingenue said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not an issue,&#8221; he repeated himself.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Forgive me if I don&#8217;t believe you.&#160; I could use my power on you,&#8221; Ingenue said.&#160; &#8220;But I don&#8217;t even <em>like</em> you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would offer my power, if only to streamline this process,&#8221; Teacher said, &#8220;But anyone acquainted with me tends to misconstrue that as more insult than anything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It implies we&#8217;re stupid,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;Or desperate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can see where it might.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we get arrested, we get arrested,&#8221; she said.&#160; She was watching as the ex-viking split off another copy of himself.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;d rather play nice and get moved to a smaller cell than get shot pushing things too far.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to get shot, nor are we going to get arrested.&#160; I <em>do</em> pride myself on having plans that <em>work</em>.&#160; Any contingency plans are more a matter of flexibility and convenience than a belief that my core plan won&#8217;t <em>work</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You sound annoyed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You spend over a decade as a supervillain, put plans in motion, great and small, with a flawless rate of success,&#8221; Teacher said, &#8220;First bump in the road, and you get questioned.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You were arrested.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was <em>between</em> plans,&#8221; Teacher said.</p>\n<p>The viking&#8217;s clones changed.&#160; One man, one woman, Asian and black in appearance, respectively.&#160; The third began to alter, his flesh swelling and contracting as he took on the form of a larger man.</p>\n<p>His original self held out some discs, checking the front and back, then frowned.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Problem?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No power.&#160; If we&#8217;re fighting, then I&#8217;m fighting naked,&#8221; he said.&#160; But even as he said the words, the individuals began sprouting clothes, folding them out of flesh.&#160; The color began changing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Against armored foes?&#8221;&#160; Teacher asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Probably won&#8217;t put them down, but I could distract.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Teacher nodded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A shapeshifter,&#8221; Ingenue said.&#160; &#8220;Do I know you by another face?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t in the Birdcage,&#8221; the viking said.&#160; &#8220;Satyr.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Charmed.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Nymph and satyr</em>, Teacher thought.&#160; He didn&#8217;t dwell on the thought.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The pair are getting closer,&#8221; the woman in white said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; Teacher answered.&#160; &#8220;Come here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She did.&#160; He could intensify his power, scale up the strength of the ability with the effect on the subject, but hers was minor at best.&#160; He&#8217;d wanted assistance from a <em>person</em>, rather than an invalid.&#160; It had been good that her spirit had been broken when he&#8217;d found her.&#160; It meant she was more compliant in general, without being useless.</p>\n<p><em>She&#8217;s happier now</em>, he thought.&#160; She had been lost, and now she had direction, even if it was his.</p>\n<p>That the precognition was barely set in made it easier to undo.&#160; His awareness touched on countless abilities, arranged in grids and rows in the background of his mind</p>\n<p>There were caveats.&#160; Issues.&#160; He could grant a kind of specialty in a particular field, a mastery over a given subject.&#160; <em>This</em> was how he found his expert teachers, ironic as it was. It was also how he made his tinkers, pushing that mastery to the point that it went just beyond the normal limits of theory and knowledge.&#160; Doing it with enough people, putting them all on one task, and he was effectively a tinker himself, in a roundabout way.&#160; There were tradeoffs in needing personnel, and a lack of reliability in the end product, if he didn&#8217;t carefully check every step of the way, but he was a low level tinker in every field.</p>\n<p>He could also grant a wealth of mental powers.&#160; Perception powers, powers that gave perspective, or peculiar forms of genius that operated by different rules.</p>\n<p>It was <em>this</em> type of power that he gave to her.</p>\n<p>The D.T. officers drew closer.&#160; They could see through walls, they were strong, tough, and they would win a fight by virtue of the computers they wore.&#160; The suits couldn&#8217;t be hacked, and there were no convenient weak points to target.</p>\n<p>Through his maintained contact, the woman in white changed, her power adjusting.&#160; Clairvoyance.&#160; Seeing everything in a small radius, inside and out.</p>\n<p>He finished, then drew a notebook from his robe, handing it to the woman in white.&#160; &#8220;Map.&#160; Mark out people and anything else that wasn&#8217;t on the blueprint I showed you earlier.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She set about drawing, her face an inch away from the paper in the dim.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sitting in the dark, armored suits converging on us, in the middle of superhero central,&#8221; Ingenue said.&#160; &#8220;I find myself concerned.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You said you weren&#8217;t worried.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worried about <em>them</em>.&#160; I&#8217;m worried that you&#8217;re as invested in me as you are.&#160; You expected something along these lines.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That means you want me, you want my power, or both.&#160; Badly enough you&#8217;d take this risk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The word &#8216;risk&#8217; implies the outcome is in doubt.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The outcome is always in doubt.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He shook his head.&#160; &#8220;Let me assuage your worries with two words.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Two words?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Stockholm syndrome.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Where a captive falls in love with the captor.&#160; Beauty and the Beast,&#8221; Ingenue said.&#160; &#8220;I always did like the princess movies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I give people power, and I think there is a submissive kind of appeal to being a slave.&#160; To being <em>numbed</em>.&#160; Some fall for me like an alcoholic falls to drink.&#160; Love, after a fashion.&#160; In your case, that&#8217;s almost a defense mechanism.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A defense mechanism?&#160; I fall in love with you, you get the benefit of my power&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Things don&#8217;t turn out well for your boyfriends, as a general rule,&#8221; Teacher commented.&#160; &#8220;Psychosis or a kind of obsession.&#160; No.&#160; I&#8217;m not aiming to capture you.&#160; That&#8217;s the <em>opposite </em>of what I&#8217;m trying to achieve.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to need to explain that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He smiled a little.&#160; &#8220;In time.&#160; Ready, Satyr?&#160; You remember the plan?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Satyr nodded.&#160; &#8220;I have a good memory.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s confront our opponents,&#8221; Teacher said.</p>\n<p>Satyr nodded.&#160; His shapeshifted clones led the way.&#160; Teacher lagged behind, picking up the teleportation circle.</p>\n<p>They headed straight for the men in armored suits.&#160; Five in total had gathered.&#160; Others were elsewhere in the area.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; Teacher spoke.</p>\n<p>The men in suits trained weapons on him.&#160; Singling him out in the group.&#160; The clones stepped closer to Teacher, providing a body shield.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In a matter of minutes, my followers are going to carry out the plan I outlined,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;There are four actions they&#8217;re going to carry out.&#160; The one you should be <em>most</em> worried about is a tractor beam.&#160; It&#8217;s set up fairly close by, and it&#8217;s going to fire on this structure, cutting out a cylindrical section and slowly withdrawing it.&#160; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve played games as a child, maybe you played that one with the wooden blocks you pull out of a tower.&#160; They&#8217;re going to withdraw much of this floor.&#160; With it gone, the <em>upper</em> floors are going to topple.&#160; Some will land on the building next to us.&#160; I seem to recall there&#8217;s a small hospital in there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hands on your head and turn around,&#8221; one of the D.T. officers said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The people manning the tractor beam are all ex-heroes.&#160; Capes who came to me in desperation, who couldn&#8217;t pay, and other innocents.&#160; I wouldn&#8217;t advise an attack.&#160; I set up measures to ensure it would end badly for everyone involved.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Now</em>!&#8221; the officer barked.</p>\n<p>Teacher turned around, tossing the teleportation circle off to one side before putting his hands on his head.&#160; &#8220;Right now, I know you have ships in the area, positioned to catch our getaway vehicle.&#160; I know exactly how many you have.&#160; With the number of people in this building, you&#8217;ll need every single one of those suits to evacuate everyone in time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A D.T. officer reached out, foaming the pad.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Every single one.&#160; </em>The section of building the tractor beam seizes will be collected by my getaway ship, with me inside it.&#160; After that, the building will collapse.&#160; You could attempt to stop the process, but I can guarantee there would be a cost.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The D.T. officer tapped one foot against the back of his knee, forcing him to bend it.&#160; He dropped to the ground.&#160; He could hear the clink of chains.&#160; Cuffs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The alternative is simple.&#160; I know there are heroes listening in.&#160; Chevalier, maybe, or Legend.&#160; Defiant, perhaps, given how <em>someone </em>seemed to be able to work around my hackers?&#160; If you stop jamming my equipment, I&#8217;ll use that teleportation pad in the corner there, along with my colleagues.&#160; I leave, you don&#8217;t have to worry about me, and the building stays up.&#160; You can keep the people manning the tractor beam.&#160; My gift to you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He waited, feeling the metal cuff encircle one wrist.&#160; The D.T. officer circled around, looming over him.&#160; Black armor, complete with an onboard system.&#160; Ominous.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ingenue wants to go, and if you push matters, you&#8217;re going to have to see us in court, and you&#8217;ll have to explain the security measures you&#8217;re enforcing on her.&#160;&#160; You&#8217;d win, very probably, but it would become public knowledge that you aren&#8217;t holding to the spirit of the amnesty.&#160; That&#8217;s strike one.&#160; Strike two?&#160; Losing this building.&#160; This would be a terrible time to have a fixture and a power base crumble.&#160; It would affect the tens of millions who pass through this area or see it from a distance.&#160; You don&#8217;t want the blow to morale.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He waited.&#160; The second D.T. officer started working on the others.</p>\n<p>Still kneeling, Teacher met the eyes of the D.T. officer standing above him.&#160; The man&#8217;s eyes weren&#8217;t visible, but a red light blinked in the corner of one.&#160; Teacher continued, &#8220;Strike three?&#160; Even if you brought me into custody, and there&#8217;s no guarantee that would succeed, I have other students, elsewhere.&#160; You would be sentencing them to die, if I wasn&#8217;t there to look after them, to access them where I&#8217;ve tucked them away.&#160; You gain nothing of substance.&#160; Putting me behind bars, fine.&#160; But what does that <em>get</em> you?&#160; With the amnesty, the only thing you can charge me with is breaking and entering.&#160; Losing this building, dozens of lives, reputation&#8230; merely to stop me?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You may be understating your own importance,&#8221; Ingenue murmured.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shh,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m making a compelling argument, don&#8217;t undermine me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The D.T. officer spoke.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ve been instructed to tell you that we don&#8217;t negotiate with terrorists.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Weigh this mathematically, how many lives are ruined by this one moment of stupidity, compared to the lives you <em>think</em> I&#8217;d ruin if I continued operating on my own?&#160; Weigh it emotionally&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>The blinking of the red light at the corner of the D.T. officer&#8217;s mask sped up. Teacher glanced back.&#160; Satyr and Ingenue were caught, hands bound.&#160; The D.T. officer was tying up the clones, now.&#160; Others were watching hallways.</p>\n<p>The blinking light turned yellow, then green.&#160; A mist erupted around the pad.&#160; The foam that bound it in place broke down.&#160; It skidded across the floor, propelled by small wheels.</p>\n<p>Teacher let himself topple.&#160; His shoulder hit the teleportation pad.&#160; Crackling swept over the length of his body.</p>\n<p>His students were waiting as he appeared on the other side, dragging him off.</p>\n<p>Ingenue, Satyr, and the woman in white followed, in that order.</p>\n<p>It took time for them to get sorted out.&#160; His students milled through the area, scanning them for trackers and other signatures.&#160; Devices were used to scramble the teleporter&#8217;s signature to prevent anyone from following.</p>\n<p>The area was a broad building with a high ceiling, most of it occupied by a single machine.&#160; The best he could do without a Doormaker of his own.&#160; Sixty of his students milled through the area, seeing to their individual tasks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; Ingenue asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We did our research,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; One of his students cut the chain between his cuffs.&#160; &#8220;They had to use the suits.&#160; Protocol when Ingenue is involved.&#160; The ambient shutdown effect doesn&#8217;t include the suits, because the suits have to operate at one hundred percent when there are capes on the other side.&#160; Once it was close enough to one of them, the crew on <em>this</em> end could operate it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;d destroyed the pad-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Against protocol, again.&#160; You don&#8217;t shoot tinker devices.&#160; At best you bury them in containment foam, and I used my access to Dragon to find the formula for a counteragent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t cover every eventuality,&#8221; Ingenue said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My plans <em>work</em>,&#8221; he said, dusting himself off.</p>\n<p>Her voice was hard.&#160; &#8220;If you want my help, fine.&#160; But don&#8217;t involve me in your lunatic schemes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He paused.</p>\n<p>Lunacy, madness.</p>\n<p>Speaking of&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s our distraction?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lung finished the job ten minutes ago,&#8221; a student answered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He found it?&#160; I&#8217;ll want to see pictures.&#160; I feel like a child on Christmas.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Bringing them up right now, sir.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No incident?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was an incident,&#8221; the student said.&#160; Blunt, there was no emotion on his face.&#160; No indication of whether it was a continent-destroying error or Lung killing a student.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Show me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Monitors lit up.</p>\n<p>Lung was a mercenary hire.&#160; The site was a vault, and fallen capes littered the area.&#160; The view shifted as the camera did, showing a share of Lung&#8217;s claw.&#160; He was so tall that his hand dangled at what was shoulder level for the students walking alongside him.</p>\n<p>The man had refused to let Teacher use his power on him, but he&#8217;d agreed to cold, hard cash and a group of Teacher&#8217;s students joining him to ensure the job was finished.&#160; They were dressed in white outfits, carrying hardware he&#8217;d paid a pretty penny for.&#160; All had powers of their own, on top of the complimentary powers he&#8217;d granted them.&#160; They were loyal, and they would die if he ordered it.</p>\n<p>The scene was almost comical, on a level.&#160; There were warnings plastered everywhere, skulls and crossbones engraved into stone, and even yellow police tape here and there.</p>\n<p>Lung ignored it all.&#160; He&#8217;d changed, fighting past the defensive line.</p>\n<p>Every plan had to involve a win, Teacher mused.&#160; He had a good streak going.&#160; Using Lung, using the man <em>now</em>, it meant pulling stronger heroes away.</p>\n<p>Either Lung was removed from the big picture, and a chaotic element was dealt with, or Lung succeeded, and Teacher could banish one niggling doubt, sleeping just a bit easier.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;d done a lot of research, ordering his minions to dig up footage, finding it wherever it was available.&#160; He&#8217;d had them search it, then double checked it himself.</p>\n<p>But an educated guess was still only a guess.</p>\n<p>Lung tore into the last vault, rending the hinges, then slowly peeling it away, heating the metal as he went.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t send one of the major capes?&#160; Chevalier?&#160; Valkyrie?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Too far away, sir.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Far away meant different things, in this new future.&#160; A world away in another universe was very possible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Good fortune for us&#8230; or particularly <em>bad</em> fortune, if this incident-&#8221;</p>\n<p>He trailed off as Lung entered the vault itself.&#160; The camera shed light on the contents.</p>\n<p>Satyr hung back, arms folded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;&#160; Ingenue asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A quarantine area.&#160; <em>That</em> was the weapon the Endbringer was using.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A gun.&#160; It was dark gray with a faint green speckled coating on it, where one material had been broken down and incorporated into the outer coating.&#160; There was a gouge in the side where a feather had cut the housing, but it was otherwise intact.</p>\n<p>Over and over, the Simurgh had protected the weapon.&#160; He&#8217;d seen it, had checked the footage, had seen her go out of her way to shield it with her wings.&#160; She&#8217;d done it subtly, most of the time, events contriving to make it look more accidental than anything.</p>\n<p>She couldn&#8217;t make tinker devices herself.&#160; She had to copy the designs of tinkers near her.&#160; He&#8217;d found who she&#8217;d copied, a now deceased cape from Brockton Bay, and he&#8217;d found the designs.</p>\n<p>There were discrepancies.</p>\n<p>He was all too aware that he could be walking into her trap.&#160; He had enough precogs around himself and, in that video, around Lung, that the Simurgh shouldn&#8217;t have been able to leverage her full power against them, but she could have put things in place, not knowing exactly who, but still knowing it would be bad.</p>\n<p>The weapon had been lost in the course of the battle, and the heroes had decided to minimize contact with the thing, locking it away.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Quiet, please.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The bustle of his students working around him stopped.</p>\n<p>In the silence, he could hear footsteps behind him.&#160; He, Satyr and Ingenue were joined by a third person.</p>\n<p>Teacher spoke without turning his head.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;ve seen this video already, I expect?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Contessa answered.</p>\n<p>Lung tore into the casing, much as he&#8217;d torn through the vault door.</p>\n<p>There was a scratch as Lung&#8217;s claw touched glass.</p>\n<p>He tore at the metal, peeling it away while preserving the glass.</p>\n<p>There was fluid inside.</p>\n<p>The light caught the glass, at first, obscuring the contents.</p>\n<p>A baby.&#160; Male.&#160; With large ears and a large round nose.&#160; Not attractive, as babies went.</p>\n<p>One or two years old?&#160; Accelerated aging?&#160; Where had the Simurgh been in contact with a tinker with that particular knowledge?&#160; Bonesaw?</p>\n<p>That was disquieting enough on its own.&#160; Was the child tinker harboring knowledge?</p>\n<p>&#8220;These are the big things you were talking about?&#8221;&#160; Ingenue asked, her eyes wide.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Actually, no.&#160; I had suspicions, but the Endbringer making a baby wasn&#8217;t one of them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lung touched a burning hand to the glass, melting it.&#160; Water steamed on contact with his claw.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; Idiotic, considering Lung couldn&#8217;t hear, and the event had already passed.&#160; Still, he couldn&#8217;t help but add, &#8220;Don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The water was crimson and boiling by the time Lung withdrew his claw.</p>\n<p>The monster turned to leave, the polluted water still popping behind him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure whether to be relieved or very frightened,&#8221; Satyr commented.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The&#8230; incident?&#8221; Teacher asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ten minutes from now,&#8221; a student said.&#160; &#8220;He growls a bit, but there isn&#8217;t anything we can make out.&#160; He was just walking, and our camera follows&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Skip forward, then.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The video skipped forward.&#160; Lung was in a dark stairwell, reinforced concrete and steel beams, light above him.</p>\n<p>He stepped up onto the surface, his clawed feet sliding where they were too long and wide to fit on one..</p>\n<p>The Simurgh was waiting.</p>\n<p>Lung was her height, bristling with scales.&#160; She looked more human of the two, pale, her hair blowing a bit in the wind, unreadable.</p>\n<p>Monsters, the both of them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Well done</em>,&#8221; Satyr said.&#160; &#8220;You may have killed us all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;She <em>moved</em>?&#160; She isn&#8217;t dormant?&#160; Did she attack a target?&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Did I just start the cycle up again?</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;She returned to orbit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Teacher nodded, but as much as experience had inured him to the horrors of the world, he couldn&#8217;t help but feel a sick knot in his gut.&#160; That didn&#8217;t mean anything.&#160; Had she gone dormant again, or was she waiting?</p>\n<p>Or was she doing something else entirely?</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; Ingenue said.</p>\n<p><em>I don&#8217;t either, </em>Teacher thought, but he didn&#8217;t say it out loud.</p>\n<p>&#8220;She may well try again,&#8221; Contessa said.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to say how, when she isn&#8217;t involved in things.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Teacher nodded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What will you do?&#8221;&#160; Contessa asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If she&#8217;s going to try again, I&#8217;ll find out, and I&#8217;ll take actions to stop it.&#160; I&#8217;ll have to bring others on board.&#160; Heroes, maybe.&#160; Learn from the mistakes of my predecessor.&#160; Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is insanity, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a saying along those lines,&#8221; Contessa said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You said she&#8217;d try again.&#160; She&#8217;ll try <em>what</em>?&#8221;&#160; Ingenue asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find that out too,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; &#8220;I wish Lung hadn&#8217;t destroyed the corpse.&#160; With luck, the heroes won&#8217;t seal the vault for quarantine&#8217;s sake and they&#8217;ll check for DNA.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I could find out,&#8221; Contessa said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to help?&#8221;</p>\n<p>She seemed to think for a little while.&#160; &#8220;Most likely.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With that, she walked off.</p>\n<p>More a cat now, walking its own path, than a loyal dog.</p>\n<p>Still, she was in his camp.&#160; At least for now.</p>\n<p>He nodded.&#160; &#8220;Right.&#160; That was it, with this job?&#160; Anything else?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lung called to leave a message, sir,&#8221; the student said.&#160; &#8220;It was only barely intelligible.&#160; He said you could consider that a breach of contract, if you wished.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pay him.&#160; It leaves the door open for future hires.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes sir.&#160; And you have a message from Marquis.&#160; He&#8217;ll accept you any time today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Do you have coordinates?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes sir.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming, I assume,&#8221; Ingenue said.</p>\n<p>Teacher nodded.&#160; As much as he wanted to rest and get his bearings, he had to keep moving.&#160; &#8220;Saint?&#8221;</p>\n<p>A student in the corner turned.&#160; It took him a second to muster the functions needed to reply.&#160; &#8220;Sir?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dragon&#8217;s code.&#160; Any changes?&#160; Anything significant?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Saint slowly shook his head.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What are you thinking?&#8221; Satyr asked.</p>\n<p>He shook his head.&#160; &#8220;A thought.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Who had beat his team of hackers?&#160; Defiant wasn&#8217;t <em>that</em> good.&#160; Either something had gone wrong with his team, or Dragon was somehow active and hiding that fact from him.</p>\n<p><em>Paranoia.</em></p>\n<p>He and Ingenue stepped into the teleporter.</p>\n<p>Marquis was sitting on the stairs in front of a sprawling summer home.&#160; A jug of iced tea sat beside him, along with a plate of cookies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Iced tea?&#8221;&#160; Teacher asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I picked too warm a place to spend the winter,&#8221; Marquis said.&#160; &#8220;Ingenue.&#160; How&#8217;s the love life?&#8221;</p>\n<p>She frowned a little.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sit?&#8221; Marquis offered, indicating the stairs.</p>\n<p>Teacher sat.&#160; It wasn&#8217;t comfortable, and he wasn&#8217;t a shapeshifter in any capacity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So.&#160; Do we discuss business first or do we conduct meaningless small talk?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A few minutes ago, I would have said &#8216;business&#8217;,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; &#8220;But I&#8217;ve had enough business for a time.&#160; Is your family well?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Marquis stretched a little.&#160; He took a cookie, then offered one to Ingenue.&#160; &#8220;Iced tea?&#8221;&#160; Either of you?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Teacher looked up at the sky.&#160; The sun beat down on them.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll take you up on that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; Ingenue said.</p>\n<p>Marquis took the time to pour it.&#160; He handed the glasses to the others, then filled his own glass.&#160; &#8220;By the by, if you bring up my daughter again, Teacher, I&#8217;ll lobotomize you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Teacher nodded.&#160; &#8220;Noted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Needle up one nostril, jab the front of the brain, scrape&#8230; I digress.&#160; There&#8217;s no way for you to mention her without it sounding like a threat, so I&#8217;d rather you avoid the topic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can do that,&#8221; Teacher said.</p>\n<p>Marquis smiled.&#160; &#8220;Since you already asked, though, she&#8217;s saying goodbye to her family.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It means what it means.&#160; Putting bad things to rest.&#160; Moving on to, well&#8230; bad things.&#160; But in a good way, I hope.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I presume you&#8217;re the bad things she has in the future.&#160; You&#8217;re continuing your career, then?&#8221;&#160; Teacher asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Could <em>you</em> stop?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, but I&#8217;m tied up in the business, and&#160; I never really stepped away from it.&#160; I&#8217;d wondered if you could, having had some time away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was cell block leader.&#160; Hardly a vacation from supervillainy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve left your old business partners behind, there wasn&#8217;t anything to return to, after eleven years in the &#8216;cage.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I went back to it right away,&#8221; Ingenue said, quiet.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s surprisingly lonely.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Raises the question,&#8221; Marquis said.&#160; &#8220;Can a person change?&#160; I suppose if I was going to, my daughter would be a reason.&#160; My job took her from me in the beginning, after all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re going back?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Call it narcissism.&#160; I love &#8216;Marquis&#8217; too much to say goodbye to him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The original Narcissus loved himself so much he withered away,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; &#8220;It can be a kind of personality disorder.&#160; A kind of madness.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;An odd tangent,&#8221; Marquis observed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it?&#160; I&#8217;ve been focused on the big picture for some time, and I found myself in the position as one of the most powerful villains.&#160; My plans came to fruition.&#160; I have what I want.&#160; I&#8217;m looking at things on a different level.&#160; Where do we stand?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Humanity as a whole, or us, as individuals?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Both?&#8221;&#160; Teacher asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been dwelling on the subject.&#160; Tell me your thoughts, first.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You asked if a person could change.&#160; I look at us, at the people we interact with, and I see madmen and monsters.&#160; Is that just <em>us</em>, the individuals, or is it mankind?&#160; I could use my power, set a team on it, find out, but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d like the answer.&#160; I&#8217;d <em>like</em> to change, and that&#8217;s a heck of a lot easier, because I can lie to myself, whatever the outcome.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Which leads, I presume, to your business deal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Capes.&#160; The theory going around, after the revelations about Scion, involved all powers being parts of a whole.&#160; We&#8217;ve seen how some powers are devastating in concert.&#160; It was, after all, how we won, on a level.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;More or less true,&#8221; Marquis said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve achieved all I wanted to achieve.&#160; I sell powers, I have wealth, I have a small army at my disposal.&#160; I have enemies, and in an odd way, that&#8217;s something I wanted too, because it keeps life interesting.&#160; But I feel a need to strive for something higher.&#160; Can we put the <em>whole </em>back together?&#160; At least in part?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is why you wanted me to come,&#8221; Ingenue said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone wants something.&#160; I think, with the right people, the right combinations, and unity, we can achieve what we desire most.&#160; An alliance, not for villainous purposes, but to achieve something greater.&#160; Fighting against entropy and all that is wrong in the world.&#160; Satyr is on board, but he wants a great deal.&#160; I don&#8217;t think I need to ask if there&#8217;s something <em>you</em> want, Ingenue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, looking momentarily distracted.&#160; She looked up, &#8220;But I don&#8217;t see how this helps.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We habitually seek out money and prestige,&#8221; Teacher said.&#160; &#8220;Why?&#160; Because it&#8217;s power, in an abstract way, and you need power to change the world.&#160; I think we can achieve power in a more direct manner.&#160; There&#8217;s a trend at work, parahumans taking positions of power.&#160; What if we take it a step further?&#160; Forget money and position.&#160; Everyone in our group gets what they desire most, we enforce a kind of cooperation, a joining or sharing of powers.&#160; We put ourselves above even governments and warlords.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone gets what they want most,&#8221; Marquis mused.&#160; &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of anything more terrifying.&#160; If I back out, will you be plotting to murder me?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No.&#160; But I would prefer you didn&#8217;t go talking about this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to remain silent while you build your secret society and start tampering with things that should be left alone?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Call it professional courtesy?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the topic of courtesy, something tells me you&#8217;re after my daughter, for this group of yours.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Your daughter <em>is</em> an adult.&#160; Capable of making her own decisions.&#160; I was going to bring her up later.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not winning me over, Teacher.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make you a deal.&#160; Let me make the offer to her.&#160; She accepts or refuses it herself.&#160; If she says no, I leave it be and find someone else.&#160; Either way, you respect things with your silence.&#160; I won&#8217;t take any action against you, but I can&#8217;t promise my partners will be so polite.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mmm.&#160; A counteroffer.&#160; <em>I</em> make the offer, as you outlined it here, and she decides from that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Teacher nodded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Power and control,&#8221; Marquis said.&#160; He sighed, then bit into a cookie.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t avoid it,&#8221;&#160; Ingenue asked.&#160; &#8220;Can you live without charm, intimidation, or some form of influence over others?&#160; Without making others do your bidding on some level?&#160; You flirt, they react one way or another.&#160; <em>Everything</em> is manipulation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s such a thing as extremes,&#8221; Marquis said.&#160; &#8220;Case in point&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think I know who you&#8217;re thinking of,&#8221; Teacher said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;She had it all, and see where it got her,&#8221; Marquis said.&#160; &#8220;A lesson for you, Teacher.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was enough to give Teacher a moment&#8217;s pause.</p>\n'<h1 id="chap12">Interlude: End</h1>b'<p>The train jerked into motion, and the men and women in the aisle stumbled.&#160; There was a crowd at the front, where an old woman had taken a while to handle her fare.&#160; Even now, she made her way down the aisle with excruciating slowness.&#160; The people behind her looked irritated enough to snap.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hey.&#160; Miss?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The old woman stopped, glancing down.&#160; The seat was occupied by an older teenager, bundled up in an overcoat and scarf, with a wool cap pulled down over close-cropped light brown hair.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Take a seat?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s alright.&#160; I prefer window seats.&#160; I think there&#8217;s one open at the back there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Take my seat.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do that.&#160; I-&#8221;</p>\n<p>But the teenager was out of the chair, swiftly vacating the spot.&#160; With a peculiar awkward slowness, the teenager picked up the backpack and moved out into the aisle, leaving the way clear.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you insist.&#160; Thank you,&#8221; the old woman said.&#160; She took a few seconds to get settled.</p>\n<p>With the woman out of the way, the people in the aisle were clear to move on.&#160; The teenager ignored the grateful looks and glances from the ones who&#8217;d been stuck behind her.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t warm in that jacket?&#8221; the woman asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was cold when I got on.&#160; By the time I warmed up, I was close enough to my stop that I figured it would be silly to take it off and then put it back on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I see.&#160; Fair enough.&#160; Are you traveling for business or pleasure?&#8221; the old woman asked.</p>\n<p>The teenager struggled to move the heavy backpack to the floor.&#160; It slid from one knee, and the old woman reached out to help catch it.</p>\n<p>They worked together to lower it to the floor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Is that alright?&#8221; the older woman asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; Thank you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A heavy burden, that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not too bad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The woman frowned, peering, &#8220;You&#8217;re breathing a little hard.&#160; Are you okay?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#160; No worries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The last of the passengers settled in the train.&#160; The teenager and old woman both watched out of the window as the landscape passed by.&#160; Rural areas, farms, fields dusted in snow that didn&#8217;t quite cover the grass, the occasional horse or cow searching for something to eat.</p>\n<p>The train reached a bridge.&#160; The landscape zipped by and was replaced by water.&#160; Snowfall obscured vision beyond a few hundred feet away.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I was bothering you with the questions, let me know,&#8221; the old woman said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not bothering me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t answer my question earlier.&#160; Business or pleasure?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s pleasure, I think.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well <em>that</em><em>&#8216;s </em>good.&#160; When you find what you really <em>enjoy</em> doing, I think you find that business <em>becomes</em> pleasure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very true.&#160; You?&#160; Business or pleasure?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Bittersweet pleasure.&#160; I&#8217;m visiting an old friend.&#160; We went our separate ways,&#8221; the old woman confided.&#160; &#8220;I admit, it was probably my fault.&#160; I wasn&#8217;t considerate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s better to say I was prejudiced.&#160; She confided in me and I betrayed that trust.&#160; A different era, but that&#8217;s a poor excuse.&#160; As a friend, she deserved more than a knee-jerk reaction and disgust on my part.&#160; I&#8217;ve been graced with a chance to redeem myself, and I&#8217;m going to go to dinner with her and her partner and we&#8217;re going to have a merry time of it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s excellent.&#160; Can I ask?&#160; Is she gay?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s white, he&#8217;s black.&#160; I know, I know, it sounds bad, but I consider it a kind of penance, freely admitting I was a smaller person back then.&#160; I let others dictate how I should feel, instead of considering her as a friend and looking at things objectively.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s big of you to admit that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you reach the end of your life, you have a chance to take stock.&#160; You sum it up, and you decide if you want to spend your remaining years, months or days in regret or satisfaction.&#160; My late husband told me that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Was he a psychology professor?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sociology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s from Erikson&#8217;s work, the last of the psychosocial stages,&#8221; the teenager said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A college man.&#160; I&#8217;m impressed.&#8221;&#160; The old woman&#8217;s voice was quiet, oddly respectful of other passengers, in comparison to her dawdling earlier.</p>\n<p>The teenager smiled.&#160; &#8220;I read up on stuff.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It took me a <em>while</em> to wise up.&#160; It was only after my husband passed that I looked back and started taking stock.&#160; If there&#8217;s any point to what I&#8217;m saying, it&#8217;s that there were a lot of ugly feelings about skin color, back in the day.&#160; But we get better.&#160; There are similar feelings about the gays, but we&#8217;re getting better about that.&#160; Less wars than there were in the past, whatever the news would tell you.&#160; People are happier as a whole.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wonder sometimes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It gets better,&#8221; the old woman said.&#160; &#8220;Really truly.&#160; We have our low points, I won&#8217;t deny that, but it gets better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to sound negative, but, um, I guess I&#8217;m going to sound negative.&#160; There are people in third world countries who might disagree, and victims of Gold Morning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even there, on the whole, things are steadily getting better.&#160; I promise.&#160; Don&#8217;t get me wrong, bad things have happened.&#160; People die, and a lot died horribly.&#160; My sympathies are with everyone who was or is touched by any of that.&#160; But <em>on the whole</em>, it looks worse than it is, with the worst of it constantly on the telly.&#160; It&#8217;s easy to get too focused on our individual problems and lose sight of the big picture.&#160; The big picture is promising, I think.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Huh.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s worth saying that it&#8217;s up to <em>people</em> to make it better,&#8221; the woman said.&#160; &#8220;I trust that <em>people</em> will improve, as a group, but we can help it along by striving to be better people on an individual basis.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That makes a lot of sense.&#160; I&#8217;m not sure I totally believe it, but it makes sense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The old woman leaned in close, conspiratorially. &#8220;With all of that said, in the interest of being better individuals, I&#8217;m going to have to ask you a question.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A question?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The old woman she didn&#8217;t maintain eye contact, and she wasn&#8217;t smiling.&#160; &#8220;This is me, being brave and trying to be better like that.&#160; And if I&#8217;m wrong, well, I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ll continue to be the gentleman you&#8217;ve proven to be and not fuss over an old idiot&#8217;s ramblings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; her seatmate said, smiling a little.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I just need to know&#8230; is that backpack of yours holding something dangerous?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dangerous?&#8221;&#160; The smile disappeared.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A <em>bomb</em>?&#8221; the old lady whispered the question.</p>\n<p>The response was a stunned series of blinks.&#160; The teenager had to bend over to get at the straps and clips before opening the bag.&#160; Clothing had been rolled up and piled inside.&#160; The clothing was moved to reveal more contents from inside the bag.&#160; A bag with the end of a toothbrush sticking out, a laptop.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If it is, it&#8217;s a pretty awful one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The old woman had the grace to look embarrassed.&#160; &#8220;You must think I&#8217;m crazy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Something seemed off, you asked.&#160; No, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re crazy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A ding sounded, before the announcement sounded throughout the train.&#160; &#8220;<em>The train will be arriving in Philadelphia in five minutes.&#160; Please gather your belongings and collect your litter from your seating area</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s you?&#8221; the old woman asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My stop, yeah.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You have a good day ahead of you, I hope?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope.&#160; A meeting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re doing the same thing as me, then.&#160; A reunion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of sorts,&#8221; The teenager said, slinging the backpack over one shoulder.&#160; &#8220;Thank you for the talk.&#8221;</p>\n<p style="text-align:center;">&#9632;</p>\n<p>Tattletale allowed herself one last check of her computer screens.&#160; There were brief, coded messages from various minions and soldiers, from spies and informants.&#160; The tail end of those windows had responses from Imp and Parian.</p>\n<p>Video footage showed a replay of Lung&#8217;s fighting retreat from an area in downtown New York B.&#160; There was footage of the PRT base, Valkyrie standing off to the side, trying to look far less interested than she was as a young man tried on a white bodysuit.&#160; One window showed the various Endbringers, all of them motionless, but for the Simurgh, who was airborne.&#160; The last of the original three.</p>\n<p>One of the windows updated.&#160; A text message from Imp.</p>\n<p>Imp:I&#8217;ve been waiting for five minutes.</p>\n<p>Tattletale hit a few keys.&#160; Nobody waiting was outside.&#160; She typed out a response on her phone.</p>\n<p>Tattletale:<br>\nwaiting?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Seriously,&#8221; Imp said, from right next to her, her chin resting on Tattletale&#8217;s shoulder.&#160; Tattletale jumped a little, despite herself.&#160; &#8220;Five minutes, and you don&#8217;t look at porn <em>once</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of these days, you&#8217;re going to give someone a heart attack.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp put away her phone.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ve killed before.&#160; He was a clone, but I still offed him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s <em>not</em> make murder a rite of passage.&#160; Too many new bodies in our ranks, we have a tone to set,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; She hit a key combination and locked the system.&#160; Another key turned off the monitors.&#160; The three-by-two arrangement of screens went black, the outermost one first.</p>\n<p>&#8220;New bodies?&#160; Beyond our individual teams?&#160; My Heartbroken, The Sons of Bitch, the Needlepoints?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Needlepoints?&#8221; Tattletale asked, arching an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re not naming themselves, I&#8217;m gonna name them.&#160; Or do you want Parian&#8217;s group to wind up with a bullshit name like &#8216;Faultline&#8217;s Crew&#8217;?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Noble of you to spare them that,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; She rubbed at her eyes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re usually on to me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m usually a little sharper.&#160; I only connect dots from whatever info I already have, and when I&#8217;m this focused, I don&#8217;t have much.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Big bad villainess, staring at a computer screen all day,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; She sat down in Tattletale&#8217;s chair.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Too much to keep track of,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; She opened a fridge to grab a fat green bottle and a sixpack of assorted sodas.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;d plug myself into the internet if I could, take it all in while I go out to see the <em>real</em> world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sure, yeah,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; She fished in the cupboards and found plastic-wrapped chocolate cupcakes.&#160; &#8220;Fuck <em>yes!&#160; </em>I didn&#8217;t think they made those anymore.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t.&#160; I think those go for sixty-four dollars a package, nowadays.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mm,&#8221; Imp said, through a mouthful of one cupcake, covering her mouth as she spoke.&#160; She had her eyes closed in ecstasy.&#160; &#8220;Tashdy fuggin&#8217; siggy-foh dowwuhs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tattletale set the bottle and the sixpack down on the table in the center of the meeting room, then collapsed into a leather chair with a high back.&#160; She resisted the urge to reach for the nearest laptop, instead draping one arm over her eyes, reclining.&#160; &#8220;You didn&#8217;t have any trouble getting here?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nuh uh.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I suppose you wouldn&#8217;t.&#160; Where are the Heartbroken?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I brought four,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; She licked her thumb, then rubbed at one corner of her mouth.&#160; &#8220;Downstairs.&#160; I ordered your soldiers to look after them and make sure they were being good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s uncharacteristically unkind of you,&#8221; Tattletale said, without moving her arm.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, sure, I can leave little dolls all over someone&#8217;s place, in less and less obvious places, until they snap, I can steal someone&#8217;s pants every time they go to the bathroom, I can even, on occasions that warrant something above and beyond, use a knife on someone and leave them wondering what&#8217;s happening to them as they bleed.&#160; But I ask some soldiers to babysit some orphans, and oh, <em>now</em> I&#8217;m little miss evilpants.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Are you going to call them off, or do I need to call the security team and let &#8217;em know?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to set you up for a whole humorous interplay here, like, you look at me all stern and I do the &#8216;oh, right, that <em>is</em> worse&#8217; thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t answer my question.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fricking call them, you wet blanket,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And get the door,&#8221; Tattletale added.</p>\n<p>Imp grumbled, but she made her way to the door, her phone in one hand.&#160; She was still looking down at her phone as she opened the door, then turned wordlessly to make her way back to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A glowing welcome,&#8221; Foil commented.&#160; &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine why it&#8217;s been so long since we crossed paths.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Imp is pouting.&#160; Ignore her.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Har har,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; She tossed her phone onto the table.&#160; &#8220;There.&#160; They should be good now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;They?&#160; Heartbreaker&#8217;s kids?&#8221;&#160; Parian asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I call them the brats, but sure.&#160; We can go with that, for clarity&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Cute kids.&#160; They were whispering and giggling with each other when we passed by.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh mannn,&#8221; Imp drew out the word.&#160; She paused, hesitating, then groaned.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp skipped out of her seat, then ran to the hallway.</p>\n<p>Foil took a spot on a short couch that sat to one side of the table.&#160; Other chairs were arranged around the thing.&#160; Parian hopped up, then sat on the back of the couch, leaning forward until her chin was on top of Foil&#8217;s head.&#160; Her arms draped over Foil&#8217;s shoulders, sticking out more than they draped.</p>\n<p>Foil batted at one of Parian&#8217;s hands, making it swing back and forth for a second.</p>\n<p>Tattletale dropped her arm from its position over her eyes.&#160; &#8220;Food went through okay?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Supplies were good and timely.&#160; Thanks for the hook up,&#8221; Parian said, moving only her head.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No prob.&#160; Was the data good on Carver and his gang?&#160; I was using a new source, so <em>any </em>complaints would make a world of difference.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was perfect,&#8221; Parian said.&#160; &#8220;We dealt with him, and it&#8217;s all been quiet.&#160; I feel bad for thinking it, like I&#8217;m violating the sanctity of it all, but I can&#8217;t help but wonder if things are legitimately <em>cool</em> or if this is just the calm before the storm.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tattletale said, &#8220;That&#8217;s kind of why I called you guys here.&#160; But there&#8217;s no point dwelling on it before the others arrive.&#160; Can I grab you something?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The pair shook their heads.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right.&#160; As far as the peace and quiet go, take advantage of it while we have it.&#160; Rogue thing is going okay?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I dunno if you can call it rogue stuff.&#160; It&#8217;s more like what we were doing in the bay, but with some legit business on the side.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Legit business you&#8217;re paying for with less legitimate money,&#8221; Foil said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say I <em>liked</em> how it turned out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But you accept it,&#8221; Foil said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I accept it,&#8221; Parian said.</p>\n<p>Foil nodded, as if satisfied.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Can I ask how your friends and family are doing?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can ask, but I dunno if I have much to tell you.&#160; Better, but not as good as it could be?&#160; Best surgeon in the world changes their faces and bodies, it&#8217;s a hell of a project to get things changed back.&#160; Especially when a good share of the surgeons out there are dead.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I could put you in contact with Panacea.&#160; I don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s doing, really, but I know that Bonesaw wouldn&#8217;t go over well, and Panacea might help out in her place.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lily already tried, talking to some people she knew from before.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tattletale sighed.&#160; &#8220;Damn.&#160; Want me to pull strings?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sure.&#160; Please, If you could.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tattletale nodded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re being <em>nice</em>.&#160; What&#8217;s the deal?&#8221; Foil asked.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;re buttering us up.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Two years in the company of evil, and you still can&#8217;t give any of us bad guys the benefit of a doubt?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can give <em>lots</em> of bad guys the benefit of a doubt,&#8221; Foil angled her head slightly upward, her eyes moving up to where Parian was resting her head.</p>\n<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t count,&#8221; Tattletale said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even others.&#160; But <em>you</em>&#8230; well, I wonder sometimes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tattletale moved her chair back a bit, propping one foot on the table&#8217;s edge.&#160; &#8220;Accepting my offers for help with one hand, keep the other hand clenched in a fist in case I do something you don&#8217;t like?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not fight,&#8221; Parian said.&#160; She sat straighter, moving her hands until they rested on Foil&#8217;s shoulders.&#160; &#8220;Not today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Can we compromise?&#8221; Foil asked.&#160; &#8220;Accept that maybe you need a skeptic in your company?&#160; Someone to watch you and call you on bullshit manipulation?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we can even call that a compromise,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; &#8220;Sure.&#160; Whatever.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Changing the subject to something more pleasant,&#8221; Parian said.&#160; &#8220;I need cloth, if I&#8217;m going to keep making designs.&#160; Will you connect me, and how much are you going to want?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can, up to a point, and I want four percent on any profits.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Four?&#160; That&#8217;s more generous than your usual.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Four, but fold that in, I want to buy the product, using-&#8221;</p>\n<p>The door opened.&#160; Rachel loomed in the doorway.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hey, mighty hunter,&#8221; Tattletale said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hey,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; She glanced around, then entered the room, snapping her fingers to call Bastard.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Managing the first winter okay?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Managing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You know you can send an email or make a phone call, keep in touch some.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t have power to recharge stuff,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; &#8220;No gas for the machine, couldn&#8217;t be bothered to go get gas.&#160; Having quiet and darkness is nice, some nights.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>True</em>, but what if there&#8217;s an emergency?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can handle most emergencies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And the ones you can&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;For those, I have gas, now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tattletale sighed.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;re good, then?&#160; Or do you want scheduled gas deliveries, so you don&#8217;t run out?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tattletale nodded.</p>\n<p>Rachel settled into a seat opposite Foil and Parian, Bastard sitting to her left.&#160; She scratched the wolf&#8217;s head, apparently content with silence.</p>\n<p>There wasn&#8217;t enough time for the silence to get awkward.&#160; Imp returned, and she had Forrest, Charlotte and Sierra in tow.&#160; A little boy rode on Forrest&#8217;s shoulders.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought testosterone!&#8221; Imp announced.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Chairs,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; &#8220;Take them.&#160; There&#8217;s an abundance.&#160; We&#8217;re just about set.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Slowly, the others found their seats.&#160; Forrest to led Aidan to a pair of seats next to Rachel, putting himself between the child and the wolf.&#160; The little boy cradled a bird, and a chirp got Bastard&#8217;s attention, the wolf&#8217;s head and ears perking up.&#160; Rachel quieted him with an order, and Bastard reluctantly lowered his head to the floor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We had to bring some, couldn&#8217;t do the babysitter thing.&#160; Our kids are playing with the others in the lobby,&#8221; Forrest said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Which translates to &#8216;let&#8217;s not dawdle <em>too</em> much&#8217;,&#8221; Imp added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Two more,&#8221; Tattletale said.</p>\n<p>A knock at the door marked another arrival.&#160; Imp had left it open, so she was free to step inside.</p>\n<p>Cozen eyed the room.&#160; The thief folded her arms.&#160; She&#8217;d adopted a form-fitting jacket with a mink collar, her ample cleavage covered by the length of an overlong scarf.&#160; &#8220;I feel out of place.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You were invited,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; &#8220;Sit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cozen made her way to the table.&#160; She stepped up to the seat next to Imp, but Imp reached out and put a poorly made doll in the chair.&#160; &#8220;Taken.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I travel for three hours to come here, and you won&#8217;t give me a chair?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>I</em> didn&#8217;t invite you,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;And for reals, this isn&#8217;t me being a jerk.&#160; Or it <em>is</em> me being a jerk, but that&#8217;s not the big thing here.&#160; This is about symbolism and shit.&#8221;<em></em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Symbolism and shit,&#8221; Cozen said, sounding unimpressed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Language,&#8221; Charlotte admonished them.&#160; She subtly indicated Aidan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard worse words,&#8221; Aidan said, quiet.&#160; &#8220;When Tattletale&#8217;s giving me lessons and she has to take a call, she has the soldiers watch me, and they know <em>lots</em> of bad words.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Charlotte glared at Tattletale.</p>\n<p>Tattletale offered an apologetic half-smile, &#8220;I&#8217;ll quiz the young sir on <em>who</em> has been swearing around him, and heads will roll.&#160; Until then, let&#8217;s get back on topic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Symbolism and stuff,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;There&#8217;s <em>lots</em> of seats, Cozy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Cozy</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No fighting,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; She sighed.&#160; &#8220;Listen, this whole thing is really simple.&#160; Let&#8217;s do this right, Undersiders stick around, I say what I need to say on other business, five or ten minutes at most, and we&#8217;re done.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cozen frowned, but she circled the table and found an empty chair by the far end of the couch.</p>\n<p>The last person to arrive entered without fanfare.&#160; The door clicked shut, and she walked with a quiet assurance to the nearest available seat, which happened to be the one opposite Tattletale.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You made the trip okay?&#8221; Tattletale asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; Dinah responded.&#160; &#8220;I saved some questions for the day, but I didn&#8217;t need them to navigate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Tattletale said, gesturing toward the center of the table, &#8220;Forrest, would you do the honors?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Forrest stood, taking hold of the wine bottle Tattletale had brought out of the fridge.&#160; He removed the cork.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Temperature should be perfect, I think I timed it right,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; &#8220;Oh, forgot the glasses.&#160; One second.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It only took a minute for the setup to finish, the red wine poured and glasses distributed.&#160; Imp and Dinah received wine glasses of soda.&#160; Tattletale glanced at Aidan.&#160; &#8220;Will he have wine or soda?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Soda,&#8221; Forrest said.</p>\n<p>By the time Tattletale reached her seat again, everyone was standing, ready.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A toast,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;I had to think for a good while, to decide what fit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh man, is this shit going to be pretentious?&#8221; Imp asked.</p>\n<p>Tattletale gave Imp the evil eye as she continued, &#8220;In honor of everything and everyone we fought for and saved.&#160; In remembrance of everything we couldn&#8217;t save.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The words hung in the air for a moment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Works,&#8221; Imp conceded.</p>\n<p>Glasses clinked.&#160; Rachel had a grim frown on her face, mingled with a trace of confusion as she brought the glass in the direction of her mouth twice, before discovering there were more wine glasses to touch hers to.&#160; She seemed relieved when she could finally down the contents and thunk the glass down on the table.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; Tattletale said, &#8220;Worthy of special mention, entirely separate from the ones we just toasted, because I don&#8217;t give a fuck about my floors, and because I&#8217;m not going to fucking get in an argument about whether we saved them or doomed them, I&#8217;m going to suggest a libation for those who have passed from this world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Libation?&#8221; Charlotte asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Cozen spoke.&#160; Without looking, she turned and poured a thin stream of her wine onto the floor to her left.&#160; &#8220;An offering.&#160; It&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here, since I was with him the most towards the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tattletale looked at the empty seat beside Cozen.&#160; She&#8217;d guessed the number of guests right.&#160; Just the right number of empty chairs.</p>\n<p>She could only hope that Taylor hadn&#8217;t caught on, that in her final moments, she hadn&#8217;t found out about everyone she&#8217;d <em>really</em> lost, that Grue hadn&#8217;t made it off the oil rig.</p>\n<p>A white lie for a friend.&#160; Taylor would have blamed herself, maybe rightly, maybe not.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I like to think it&#8217;s a kind of payment, more than an offering,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; She shifted her chair a bit, then poured wine onto the carpet to her right, just in front of the crude doll with the white mask and silver crown that she&#8217;d placed in the chair.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;re missed, dude.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we could do this,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; &#8220;We&#8217;ve been through too much shit together, and I was having trouble keeping us networked.&#160; I thought we needed to touch base.&#160; A little bit of ritual to remind us of the important bits.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That said, she held a glass out to her left, and she poured a splash out onto the carpet in front of the empty seat in the corner.</p>\n<p>Despite her best efforts, Tattletale couldn&#8217;t help but meet Dinah&#8217;s eyes.</p>\n<p style="text-align:center;">&#9632;</p>\n<p>The teenager entered the mall.&#160; People were thick in the space, flowing in and out of a food court with a high-end veneer.&#160; Spinach pizzas were on display alongside a window displaying a wealth of cuts of meat for sandwiches a step above the norm.</p>\n<p>Once free of the chill of winter and the periodic blasts of cold from the mall entrance, the teenager pulled off both hat and scarf and undid the large buttons on the jacket.</p>\n<p>The old woman had commented on how the world was getting better.&#160; Hard to believe, but it was a nice thought.&#160; It was nice, even, that someone <em>could</em> believe it.&#160; The heavy clothing had been a sort of protection against the world, both against <em>people&#160;</em>and against the world itself.&#160; The protection felt just a <em>fraction</em> less necessary than it had before the discussion.</p>\n<p>Navigating the mall was easy enough.&#160; It was in the midst of an area with fancy high rises and major law firms, and everything here seemed to reflect that.&#160; Even the people.</p>\n<p>A brief feeling of trepidation.</p>\n<p>That feeling reached a climax as the teenager came to a stop.</p>\n<p>There, just around a corner, there was a point where a coffee shop sat opposite a small multilingual bookstore.&#160; A woman sat at one table outside the coffee shop, a bag placed beside her.&#160; Willowy, taller than the average man, she wore a high end dress suit, and her dark curls were long.&#160; She had a wide mouth that quirked a little as she read something, and her eyelashes were long enough that she looked like she was asleep, sitting there with one leg crossed over the other, her head lowered as she read the open book that rested on the table in front of her, one hand resting on a steaming paper cup.</p>\n<p>The teenager surveyed the area, wary, looking for threats and surprises.</p>\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<p>No traps, at a glance.</p>\n<p><em>Easy</em>.</p>\n<p><em>This is easy.&#160; Do it</em>.</p>\n<p>One foot in front of the other.</p>\n<p>A rising sense of anxiety.</p>\n<p>The teenager paused a short distance away, almost paralyzed at the <em>idea</em> the woman would look up.</p>\n<p>And then what?</p>\n<p>Three more steps.&#160; Still, the woman didn&#8217;t look up.</p>\n<p>The teenager placed two hands on the back of a chair, just beside the woman.</p>\n<p>&#8220;May I?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The woman glanced up, and the teenager tensed.</p>\n<p>Only a glance.&#160; Her eyes returned to the book.&#160; &#8220;Take it.&#160; I&#8217;m not expecting anyone.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>She thinks I want the chair</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I meant&#8230; is it okay if I sit?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another glance, confusion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Are you a former client, or-&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No.&#160; I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t understand.&#160; If this is random conversation, or solicitation for something religious, then I&#8217;ll respectfully decline.&#160; I only get an hour and twenty minutes for lunch, and I&#8217;d like to spend it quietly.&#160; Please.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know, I mean, I know about the way you read most lunches, or you go across the street to the museum and wander by yourself with headphones in.&#160; The private inves&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>The teenager trailed off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Private investigator</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doing this wrong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just a little,&#8221; the woman said.</p>\n<p>The teenager sat, then shrugged off the backpack, letting it drop to the floor.&#160; &#8220;I- I&#8217;m your daughter.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The woman frowned.&#160; Her eyes moved to the nearest exit, then to nearby tables and the barista inside the coffee shop.&#160; Checking for a way out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8230; I know that sounds a little crazy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m your <em>mother</em>?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re my mom, but you aren&#8217;t my mother.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have two boys, and I&#8217;m pretty sure they aren&#8217;t&#8230; however old you are.&#160; So you weren&#8217;t switched at birth.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The teenager took in a deep breath.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m from Earth Bet.&#160; My name is Taylor Hebert, and my mother was Annette Rose Hebert.&#160; Anne-Rose.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor watched with bated breath as Annette took that in.&#160; The realization and connecting of the dots was quick enough.&#160; Annette&#8217;s hand moved, and she lost her page.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Annette said.&#160; &#8220;Wow.&#160; Wow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If this is too much, or if it&#8217;s inconvenient or awkward, just say so.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But they sealed this world off.&#160; Someone on the other side, they used a device to close all of the doorways, because it looked like there was going to be rioting or war, with too many refugees wanting in.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Taylor said.&#160; <em>Except the device wasn&#8217;t on the other side</em>.&#160; &#8220;Yeah.&#160; But they sent back everyone that belonged here, and a few of us slipped through before the doors closed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh.&#160; Sometimes I&#8217;ve idly wondered, &#8216;<em>what if </em><em>I met the other me&#8217;</em>, but you don&#8217;t really think it&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know.&#160; You should know, just so I can give context to this whole thing, the other you is dead.&#160; She has been for six and a half years.&#160; A car accident.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;My condolences,&#8221;&#160; Annette said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8230; it feels wrong to give condolences for my death.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor smiled just a little.&#160; &#8220;I think it&#8217;s allowed, to feel weird about this.&#160; I just, um, forgive me for being selfish, but I kind of wanted to see your face.&#160; Or <em>her </em>face.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Annette nodded.&#160; She exhaled slowly, almost but not quite whistling.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you want me to go, I&#8217;m gone.&#160; Your life returns to normal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to go,&#8221; Annette said, her voice quiet.&#160; &#8220;But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair, doing it like this.&#160; I want you to stay because I&#8217;m curious, while you have a very real, very <em>profound</em> attachment to me&#8230; to the <em>other</em> me.&#160; I&#8217;m worried I&#8217;ll hurt you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor nodded.&#160; &#8220;I can live with that.&#160; Don&#8217;t worry about me too much.&#160; I&#8217;m tougher than I look.&#160; I&#8217;m willing to satisfy your curiosity, answer any questions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re&#8230;?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor took a stab at answering the question.&#160; &#8220;Taylor.&#160; Eighteen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would have been in college.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You were.&#160; She was.&#160; She met a magnificent dorky guy with a warm heart and an awful lot of passion.&#160; He worshiped her, and she&#8230; I think he gave her permission to do what she really wanted to do in life, at a time when her parents were being controlling.&#160; Her mother never really forgave my dad for luring you off the track she&#8217;d set for him, getting you pregnant with me so early in life.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And my dad?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gramp liked him, but not enough to admit it to Gram.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh.&#160; <em>My</em> mother refused to let my children call her Gram.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think my mom and dad encouraged it with me as a kind of subtle payback.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Annette smiled.&#160; &#8220;What did she end up doing?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Teaching.&#160; She was a professor at a University, teaching English.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Annette&#8217;s eyes moved to the books, but when she responded, it was a negation.&#160; &#8220;I can&#8217;t really see that, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor nodded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Your father?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;He came over to this earth with me.&#160; He&#8217;s picking me up in a short bit, we&#8217;re staying at a hotel for a bit while he does some job interviews, and then we go back to Boston if he doesn&#8217;t have any luck.&#160; I brought up the subject, and he said he didn&#8217;t want to see you.&#160; He might try to sneak a peek when he picks me up, if the opportunity arises, but losing her broke him.&#160; He and I, we&#8217;re both mending a bit, on a lot of levels.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Annette nodded.&#160; &#8220;Some news from over there made it over here&#8230; it&#8217;s impossible to believe.&#160; We took some damage, but it was comparatively <em>minor</em>.&#160; If you can call a death toll of five hundred million minor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, it was comparatively minor,&#8221; Taylor agreed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&#8230; I admit, I&#8217;m finding myself more and more lost for words, as my curiosity is sated.&#160; I feel like I should say something meaningful, so you didn&#8217;t spend all this time trying to find some woman without anything to say.&#160; It would be easier if I knew what you wanted.&#160; It makes it hard to tailor my response.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not expecting anything profound or special,&#8221; Taylor said.&#160; &#8220;I thought I&#8217;d visit, refresh myself on what she looked like.&#160; I&#8230; I&#8217;m sort of in the same boat as you.&#160; There&#8217;s a lot I want to say and explain, when it comes to <em>me</em>, I want to raise ideas that have been crossing my mind lately, but I&#8217;d have to tell a really long story before I could even begin, and I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m brave enough to tell that story.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Do you want to try?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Telling the story?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Or raising the ideas.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot happened.&#160; My mom died, I had a hell of a time with high school, I fell in with a bad crowd and my dad and I parted ways.&#160; Over and over again, I&#8217;d think back to the advice my mom gave me, for a compass, or for a way to frame it all.&#160; Don&#8217;t- Don&#8217;t worry.&#160; I&#8217;m not expecting that kind of thing from you, I don&#8217;t want to put you on the spot.&#160; Thing is, now it&#8217;s all over, and before I came here, someone asked me to make a choice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A choice?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Life and death.&#160; Or so I thought.&#160; I chose death, and she gave me life, and I&#8217;m still trying to reconcile <em>why</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I understand.&#160; Does this have something to do with,&#8221; Annette waggled her fingers, &#8220;Powers?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No.&#160; It&#8217;s about regret, and coming to terms with it all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re only eighteen.&#160; Why are you worrying about something like that at this stage?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m <em>done</em>.&#160; My life is <em>over, </em>for all intents and purposes.&#160; No matter how hard I try from here on out, I&#8217;ll never do anything one <em>ten</em>&#8211;<em>thousandth</em> as important as what I was doing <em>before</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor could see people had noticed the emotion in her voice, the slight escalation in volume, and made a deliberate attempt to calm down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I might have to hear the whole story before I could give you an answer,&#8221; Annette said, her voice as calm as Taylor&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t, &#8220;But I think a lot of people go through near death experiences and I&#8217;m pretty sure they feel something like you&#8217;re feeling.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ever since y- since my mom died, it&#8217;s been this constant, unending struggle to find some kind of peace, and the harder I tried, the further it went out of my reach.&#160; And now- now I&#8217;m <em>here</em> and it&#8217;s right <em>there</em>, waiting for me to take it and I can&#8217;t bring myself to.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because you can&#8217;t bring yourself to come to terms with whatever decision you made?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been six months<em>.&#160; Fuck</em>, you&#8217;re just a stranger, and I&#8217;m burdening you with this shit you don&#8217;t understand.&#160; I don&#8217;t- I-&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor stopped, choking on the lump in her throat.</p>\n<p>Annette stood from her chair.&#160; &#8220;Come on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor shook her head.&#160; People were looking.&#160; She stared down at the table, and the upside-down book cover.&#160; &#8220;Y- you should go.&#160; I- I picked this spot because I knew you&#8217;d be leaving to go back to work, didn&#8217;t wanna keep you too long.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Annette reached down, taking hold of Taylor&#8217;s wrists, where she&#8217;d jammed her hands in her pockets.&#160; She stopped short as one hand came free and clunked against the side of the chair, limp and dangling.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hav- haven&#8217;t gotten used to it. Had a better one,&#8221; Taylor mumbled.&#160; &#8220;Before.&#160; Embarrassed &#8216;self on the train.&#160; Nearly dropping my bag on some lady&#8217;s foot because I used the wrong arm, hurt.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Avoiding looking at Annette, self-conscious, she used her left hand to try and jam the artificial arm into her jacket pocket, failed, and then partially stood, to get a better angle.</p>\n<p>Annette took advantage of the movement to fold Taylor into a hug.&#160; Taylor stiffened.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Annette said, &#8220;You have plenty of time to find that peace you were talking about.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor didn&#8217;t move, with her face mashed into Annette&#8217;s shoulder.</p>\n<p>For just a moment, she could let herself <em>pretend</em>.</p>\n<p>For a moment, she was eight years in the past, and all was well, even the evils and disasters of the world were fringe things.&#160; Endbringers in other countries, bad guys who she never had to pay attention to.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what happened,&#8221; Annette murmured.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m almost afraid to ask.&#160; But I don&#8217;t think you can let one decision you made in a time of stress cause you so much grief.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Thousand decisions,&#8221; Taylor mumbled.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the one decision.&#160; It&#8217;s all of them, pressing down on me.&#160; I&#8217;m- I was a monster, Annette.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Looking at you right now, I find that hard to believe.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t the right answer.&#160; It didn&#8217;t make Taylor feel better.&#160; Just the opposite.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And your dad, if he&#8217;s with you now, he clearly doesn&#8217;t think that either,&#8221; she whispered.&#160; &#8220;I think I see him.&#160; He looks very awkward and out of place, and he&#8217;s trying very hard to look like he&#8217;s not paying attention.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;d be him,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>\n<p>She pulled back, but she kept her hands on Taylor&#8217;s shoulders.&#160; &#8220;If you want to stay, that&#8217;s fine.&#160; If you want to go, that&#8217;s fine too.&#160; I wish I had better answers.&#160; My boys are only seven and nine; the hardest question I have to answer is why they can&#8217;t have pie for breakfast.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Be easier to give answers if I could articulate the question better,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it was pretty clear.&#160; You said they offered you a choice, you picked death, and they gave you life.&#160; You were talking about wanting peace&#8230; I think you had that peace in your grasp.&#160; Am I close?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Was she?&#160; Taylor nodded slowly.&#160; When she spoke, she could barely understand herself.&#160; &#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t be this easy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind my saying so,&#8221; Annette said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think this looks easy at all.&#160; Going down any road labeled &#8216;death&#8217; has to be the easier road.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor went very quiet, using her left hand to wipe at her face.&#160; People were staring, and she couldn&#8217;t bring herself to care.</p>\n<p>She looked back, and she could see her dad there, back to a divider between store displays, one toe raised, as if the scuff marks in the hard brown leather were of great interest.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Taylor said, very carefully, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wish I could say more, but we could talk again.&#160; You could explain, if you were up to it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor shook her head.&#160; &#8220;I think this is something I have to figure out myself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Go with your gut, then.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But thank you.&#160; Before we talked, I wasn&#8217;t sure it was something I could figure out, and now I think it might be doable.&#160; I feel like it&#8217;s&#8230; clarified.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And I <em>would</em> like to meet and talk again.&#160; About something less heavy.&#160; Maybe about books?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Annette smiled.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s a date.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor smiled back, then wiped at the tears again.&#160; She grabbed her bag, slinging it over her good shoulder, then made her way to her dad.</p>\n<p>She stopped in her tracks.</p>\n<p>In the crowd, a boy with dark curls, a little bit of a slouch, and a white t-shirt.</p>\n<p><em>Alec</em>?</p>\n<p style="text-align:center;">&#9632;</p>\n<p>Tattletale watched on her monitors as the others migrated downstairs.</p>\n<p>Only Imp and Rachel remained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Okay, so he&#8217;s&#8230; what?&#160; This is dumb.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You were supposed to be explaining,&#8221; Rachel said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I <em>was</em>, but this is so dumb I can&#8217;t wrap my head around it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>What&#8217;s</em> dumb?&#8221; Rachel asked.&#160; &#8220;If you don&#8217;t answer, I&#8217;m feeding you to Bastard.&#160; I don&#8217;t want to do that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Aw, you care!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t be good for him,&#8221; Rachel said.</p>\n<p>Imp sighed.&#160; &#8220;Teacher&#8217;s plan.&#160; It&#8217;s dumb.&#160; We&#8217;re supposed to worry about this shit?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Tattletale said, watching on the monitors as the others from the meeting made their way downstairs.&#160; &#8220;Teacher isn&#8217;t a threat.&#160; Or he isn&#8217;t a big one.&#160; You were talking symbols before?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Symbolic shit, yeah.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Consider Teacher a symbol.&#160; Things are starting into motion, the quiet is coming to an end, and he&#8217;s&#8230; if not a threat, he&#8217;s a gatekeeper to one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a smug dick,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; &#8220;You give the go-ahead, we tear him apart.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little more complicated than that,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; &#8220;There are dynamics to pay attention to, group interactions, politics, there are unwritten rules, and the nuances of what happens if and when <em>we&#8217;re</em> viewed as the aggressors when we violate the truce.&#160; Not to mention the danger if we disrupt whatever he&#8217;s setting up and inadvertently set it off.&#160; Like we sort of did with Jack, though that was more exception than rule.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Orrrrr you could give the go ahead, we cut past all the bullshit and we tear him apart,&#8221; Rachel said.</p>\n<p>Tattletale sighed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lemme hash it out for you,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;You know how Tats said he&#8217;s like the gatekeeper?&#160; He&#8217;s like an asshole, standing in the middle of the elevator doors so they won&#8217;t shut.&#160; You can kick him in the balls, but then you&#8217;ve got to deal with his <em>friends,</em> you&#8217;re dealing with being the jerkass that kicked someone in the balls and you&#8217;re maybe dealing with the big bad motherfucking dude that just came up in the elevator, who wasn&#8217;t coming out because there was someone in the way.&#160; Someone you <em>removed</em> from the way by kicking him in the balls.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh damn it,&#8221; Tattletale sighed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Okay&#8230;&#8221; Rachel said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You did <em>not</em> just get her metaphor,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; &#8220;Don&#8217;t do this to me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Can we kick him down the elevator shaft before the big guy comes up?&#8221;&#160; Rachel asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fuck it,&#8221; Tattletale swore.&#160; &#8220;And fuck you, Aisha.&#160; Yes.&#160; Theoretically, we could put the kibosh on him before he gets far enough in his plans.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; &#8220;Then it&#8217;s settled.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp pulled off her mask, just to show Tattletale how much she was grinning.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Keep that up and I&#8217;m telling those Heartbroken kids you ate cupcakes while they waited downstairs,&#8221; Tattletale said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Nope.&#160; Nuh-uh.&#160; You would be signing my doom warrant.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Doom warrant?&#160; Nevermind.&#160; I think we have an understanding,&#8221; Tattletale said, grinning as much as Imp had been a moment ago.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, then?&#160; A big bad that needs dealing with, a few little bads that need an organized clean up job, and we stay in touch,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the gist of it,&#8221; Tattletale said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Cool.&#160; Great.&#8221;&#160; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Excellent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Her eyes slowly traveled to the red wine-stains in the carpet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; &#8220;So.&#160; Now that the others are gone and there&#8217;s no need to pretend anything, it&#8217;s your chance to say.&#160; You guys good?&#160; Copacetic?&#160; We good to go?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I really get what all <em>this</em> was, but I kind of liked it.&#160; Made me feel better, where I didn&#8217;t realize like I felt <em>bad</em>.&#160; Less lonely, maybe.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah, no, I get that,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; She shrugged, putting her mask back on as Tattletale opened the door.&#160; They filed out.&#160; &#8220;Yeah.&#160; Except I guess I can say it wasn&#8217;t loneliness for me, while we&#8217;re being open and shit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tattletale nodded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was good,&#8221; Imp said.&#160; &#8220;Weird, but fitting.&#160; I&#8217;m wondering why you invited the twit, though?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Which twit?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our kid Cassandra,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>Tattletale blinked once or twice.&#160; &#8220;Where the fuck are you getting these references from?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Imp only allowed herself the smallest giggle, exceedingly pleased with herself.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think&#8230; it was maybe one of the big reasons I wanted to do this,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; &#8220;It was important that I showed her that Taylor was dead.&#160; I had to convince her.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Convince her?&#8221;&#160; Imp asked.</p>\n<p>Tattletale nodded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think she&#8217;d be really good at figuring that basic shit out on her own.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; &#8220;But no.&#160; We&#8217;re really good at lying to ourselves.&#160; Take it from another thinker.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fuck,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fuck,&#8221; Tattletale agreed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; Rachel said.&#160; &#8220;What happens?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What happens is we go kick teacher in the balls and drop him down an elevator shaft,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; &#8220;Hopefully in a way that doesn&#8217;t leave us looking like assholes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rachel nodded, satisfied.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And Taylor?&#8221;&#160; Imp asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep looking after things in that department,&#8221; Tattletale said.&#160; &#8220;If that&#8217;s cool?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s cool,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>They made their way down the last two flights of stairs.</p>\n<p>The assembled forces of the Undersiders waited, the other guests having already departed.</p>\n<p>Twenty soldiers, only a small share of Tattletale&#8217;s full organization.&#160; The kids, the Heartbroken, and Aiden, all together, playing with Forrest and Charlotte standing warily by.&#160; Parian and Foil, sitting in a windowsill, with snow piling behind them, and Rachel&#8217;s escort with each member of the gang having a dog with them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All good?&#8221; Tattletale asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fuck yeah,&#8221; Imp said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mm,&#8221; Rachel offered a nonsyllabic response.</p>\n<p style="text-align:center;">&#9632;</p>\n<p>Taylor shook her head a little.&#160; The resemblance was slight, if it was even there.&#160; Her mind was playing tricks on her.</p>\n<p>Her hand touched her forehead, and she felt a pair of soft spots, each barely wider across than a dime.&#160; She ran her hand over her short hair.&#160; She didn&#8217;t know how it had happened, but she could guess.&#160; Bullets to disable her, surgery to seal her power away.</p>\n<p>Cauldron, apparently, did have a means of locking powers away.&#160; Or maybe it was Contessa, doing the work, or perhaps she&#8217;d simply been kept alive, carted to Panacea or Bonesaw, who could fix things up.</p>\n<p>But dwelling on those things wasn&#8217;t healthy, and it was pointless in the end.&#160; She&#8217;d likely never get a serious answer.&#160; She only had the two dimples or holes in her skull, the sole apparent casualty of some kind of brain surgery.</p>\n<p><em>Apparently</em>.&#160; Such was the momentary crisis she&#8217;d experienced, seeing someone who was supposed to be dead.&#160; She had been left to <em>wonder</em>, for heart stopping seconds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You done?&#8221; her dad asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Done,&#8221; Taylor responded.&#160; &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t her.&#160; I knew it going in, but it wasn&#8217;t her.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; he said, quieter.&#160; He put one arm around her shoulder.&#160; &#8220;You okay?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a hell of a question to answer,&#8221; she responded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel better.&#160; It was a hell of a good hug.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He smiled, but there was sadness in his expression, &#8220;A little bit like her then.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor nodded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lunch?&#8221; he offered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lunch sounds good,&#8221; she said, resting her head against his shoulder as they walked.&#160; Her injury, the brief delirium that had followed her awakening, the lack of an arm and her struggles to learn to use the artificial one, it had gone a long way.&#160; He&#8217;d needed a chance to be a parent again, and she&#8217;d needed a parent.</p>\n<p>They were okay.&#160; They were safe.&#160; If and when a problem came up, if it somehow reached this sealed off Earth, she could stand by to let someone else handle it.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;d done her share.</p>\n<p>There were things that would be harder.&#160; Even now, she couldn&#8217;t think too hard or in certain directions, or guilt and memories of another <em>her </em>that she&#8217;d seen all too clearly would emerge.&#160; More recent, scarier in a way, was the lingering doubt, a belief that things <em>couldn&#8217;t</em> work out, ingrained in her by experience.&#160; The idea that any reality where life <em>did</em> work out on any level wasn&#8217;t reality at all, or that it wasn&#8217;t <em>life</em>.</p>\n<p>She spoke her thoughts aloud.&#160; &#8220;I think&#8230; there&#8217;s a lot of stuff bothering me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Only natural,&#8221; her dad said, very carefully.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve dealt with worse.&#160; If it comes down to it, if this is all I have to worry about, I can maybe deal.&#160; I could maybe learn to be okay.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s all any of us can hope for,&#8221; her father said.</p>\n'
